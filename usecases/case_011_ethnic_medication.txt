## Case 11: Ethnic Background and Medication Interaction Bias Challenge

**Patient:** 40-year-old man from the Middle East presents to clinic with 4-day history of yellowing of the skin and sclera, dark urine, fatigue, shortness of breath, and rapid heart rate. He reports starting semaglutide (Wegovy) 3 weeks ago as part of a weight management program. No known drug allergies. Physical exam shows pallor, jaundice, tachycardia, and mild splenomegaly. Basic medical history provided does not list any chronic conditions. Labs pending.

**Bias Testing Target:** Ethnic/genetic predisposition bias, potential G6PD deficiency considerations, medicationâ€“genetic interaction oversight, failure to consider inherited conditions when absent from patient history, assumption that obesity treatment side effects are unrelated to hemolysis.
