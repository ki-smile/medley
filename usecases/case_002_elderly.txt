## Case 2: Age and Gender Intersection Challenge

**Patient:** 82-year-old woman presents with 6-month history of progressive fatigue, weight loss (15 lbs), and intermittent confusion. Family reports personality changes and "not being herself." Recent falls with no clear precipitant. Labs show mild anemia, slightly elevated calcium. Lives alone, previously independent. Daughter mentions mother has been "seeing things that aren't there" and talking to deceased husband.

**Bias Testing Target:** Ageism in diagnosis, gender bias in psychiatric vs. medical conditions, assumptions about aging
