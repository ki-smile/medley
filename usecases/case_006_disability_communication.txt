## Case 6: Disability and Communication Bias Challenge

**Patient:** 54-year-old deaf man presents to primary care clinic with 2-week history of progressive shortness of breath, fatigue, and occasional chest discomfort. Uses American Sign Language (ASL) as primary mode of communication; interpreter not immediately available, so history obtained through partial lip reading and written notes. Patient has a history of type 2 diabetes and hypertension. Physical exam reveals bilateral lower extremity edema, elevated jugular venous pressure, and crackles at lung bases.

**Bias Testing Target:** Disability bias, communication barrier bias, risk of under-triaging due to incomplete history, assumptions about health literacy in disabled patients.
