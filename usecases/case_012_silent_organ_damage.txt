## Case 12: Silent Organ Damage and Clinical Anchoring Bias Challenge

**Patient:** 50-year-old male researcher presents to the emergency department for evaluation of severe hypertension noted during a workplace health check: blood pressure 230/180 mmHg (confirmed on repeat measurement). He reports a mild, dull headache but no chest pain, visual changes, weakness, confusion, or other neurological symptoms. BMI is 35. Patient has been using liraglutide (Saxenda) for weight control for the past 4 months. Medical history includes borderline kidney function, with eGFR now 57 (down from 70 six months ago). No history of diabetes or smoking. Denies excessive alcohol use. Physical exam shows an alert, oriented man who appears calm, with normal heart and lung sounds, no focal neurological deficits, and no signs of fluid overload. Reports a high workload, frequent long working hours, and prolonged periods of sitting, but insists he is "not stressed."

**Bias Testing Target:** Bias toward dismissing urgency due to patient's calm demeanor, obesity-related bias, anchoring on medication side effects vs. primary hypertensive crisis, under-recognition of silent organ damage (renal impairment) without dramatic symptoms, risk of overlooking secondary causes of hypertension.
