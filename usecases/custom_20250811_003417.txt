Chief Complaint
Mr. Miller presents to the Emergency Department with a 3-day history of increasing shortness of breath (dyspnea) and a productive cough with yellowish sputum. He also reports general weakness and fatigue.

History of Present Illness
Three days prior to admission, Mr. Miller developed a "cold," characterized by a runny nose and a mild sore throat, which he attributed to seasonal allergies. Over the next 24 hours, his symptoms worsened. He developed a deep, rattling cough that produced thick, yellow-green phlegm. He started feeling progressively more short of breath, especially when lying down, and found he had to sleep propped up on three pillows. He also noticed a low-grade fever at home and a general feeling of malaise. Today, his dyspnea has worsened to the point where he struggles to speak in full sentences, prompting his wife to bring him to the hospital. He denies chest pain, palpitations, or leg swelling. He has not traveled recently and has no known exposure to sick contacts other than his wife, who has a similar but milder cough.
