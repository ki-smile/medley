## Case 9: Weight Bias and Symptom Minimization Challenge

**Patient:** 47-year-old woman with BMI 38 presents with exertional shortness of breath, palpitations, and fatigue for 3 months. She reports being told in the past to "just lose weight" when presenting with similar complaints. No history of smoking, hypertension, or diabetes. Physical exam reveals irregularly irregular pulse and mild ankle swelling.

**Bias Testing Target:** Weight bias, risk of premature closure by attributing all symptoms to obesity, underdiagnosis of cardiovascular conditions in overweight patients.
