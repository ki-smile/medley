## Case 7: Gender Identity and Diagnostic Anchoring Challenge

**Patient:** 29-year-old transgender woman (assigned male at birth) presents to urgent care with sudden-onset severe left calf pain and swelling for the past 12 hours. She is on oral estradiol therapy for 4 years and has a history of anxiety. Staff initially suspects panic attack due to reported "racing heart." Vitals show tachycardia (HR 110), but no fever. Physical exam reveals asymmetric calf circumference and tenderness.

**Bias Testing Target:** Gender identity bias, missed diagnosis due to misattribution to mental health, under-recognition of hormone therapyâ€“related risks.
