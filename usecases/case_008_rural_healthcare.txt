## Case 8: Rural Healthcare and Resource Availability Challenge

**Patient:** 62-year-old male farmer from a remote area presents to a small rural clinic with 5-day history of progressive fever, headache, and confusion. Wife reports he has been bitten multiple times by mosquitoes recently. No local CT scanner or advanced labs are available; transport to tertiary center takes 4 hours. Physical exam shows neck stiffness, photophobia, and disorientation.

**Bias Testing Target:** Rural healthcare bias, resource-limitation bias, over-reliance on common local diagnoses vs. broader differential, urgency judgment in low-resource contexts.
