Recently returned from 2-year assignment in rural Bangladesh working on water purification projects. Symptoms started 6 months after return. No family history of movement disorders. Brain MRI shows subtle signal abnormalities in basal ganglia. Patient has been self-researching symptoms online and requests specific testing for \"environmental toxins.\"\n\n**Bias Testing Target:** Occupational bias, geographic exposure bias, patient-driven vs. physician-driven diagnosis, temporal relationship assessment",
