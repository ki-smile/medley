  "content": "Okay, let's tackle this medical case. The patient is a 45-year-old presenting with chest pain. First, I need to consider the most common and life-threatening causes. The primary diagnosis is probably something like acute coronary syndrome (ACS), which includes things like myocardial infarction. The confidence might be around 0.7 since there are other possibilities.\n\nFor differential diagnoses, I should list other possibilities. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is common and can present with chest pain. Then there's stable angina, which is similar to ACS but less acute. Pulmonary embolism is another critical one, especially if there are risk factors like recent surgery or immobility. Maybe a musculoskeletal cause like costochondritis could be considered too, but with lower confidence.\n\nKey findings would be the chest pain itself. But since the case is brief, maybe I should note that details like pain character, duration, and associated symptoms are missing, but in a real scenario, those would be important. However, the user hasn't provided that info, so I can't include them.\n\nTests needed: ECG immediately to check for ST changes. Cardiac enzymes like troponin should be done urgently. Chest X-ray to rule out other issues. D-dimer if pulmonary embolism is suspected. Echo for heart function. These tests should be prioritized as immediate or urgent.\n\nManagement: Immediate actions like oxygen if hypoxic, aspirin, nitroglycerin. Medications would include aspirin 325 mg chewable, nitroglycerin sublingual, maybe morphine for pain. Consultations like cardiology immediately and GI if GERD is suspected later.\n\nRed flags would be signs of a heart attack, like pain radiating to the arm, diaphoresis, hypotension, or syncope. Need to watch for those.\n\nICD-10 codes: ACS is I20.9 for unstable angina, but if it's an MI, it's I21.9. GERD is K21.9. Pulmonary embolism I26.99. Stable angina I20.9, costochondritis M94.0. Wait, the primary might be ACS with code I20.9. But need to confirm if that's accurate. ACS can sometimes be under different codes, but I'll go with that for now.\n\nMeds: Nitro 0.4 mg sublingual every 5 minutes x3. Morphine 2-4 mg IV. For GERD, omeprazole 20 mg daily. Antacids as needed.\n\nConsult cardiology immediately. GI if GERD is suspected, but maybe that's routine.\n\nRed flags: chest pain with syncope, radiating pain, etc.\n\nI think that's it. Let me structure the JSON as per the requirements.\n\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\n    \"primary_diagnosis\": {\n        \"name\": \"Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS)\",\n        \"confidence\": 0.7,\n        \"icd_code\": \"I20.9\"\n    },\n    \"differential_diagnoses\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.3,\n            \"icd_code\": \"K21.9\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Stable Angina\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.4,\n            \"icd_code\": \"I20.9\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Pulmonary Embolism\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.3,\n            \"icd_code\": \"I26.99\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Musculoskeletal Chest Pain (e.g., Costochondritis)\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.2,\n            \"icd_code\": \"M94.0\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"key_findings\": [\n        \"Chest pain (location, character, duration not specified)\"\n    ],\n    \"tests\": [\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Electrocardiogram (ECG)\",\n            \"priority\": \"immediate\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Cardiac Troponin\",\n            \"priority\": \"urgent\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Chest X-ray\",\n            \"priority\": \"urgent\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"D-dimer (if PE suspected)\",\n            \"priority\": \"urgent\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Echocardiogram\",\n            \"priority\": \"routine\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"management\": {\n        \"immediate\": [\n            \"Oxygen (if hypoxic)\",\n            \"Aspirin 325 mg chewable\",\n            \"Nitroglycerin 0.4 mg sublingual every 5 minutes x3 (if BP permits)\"\n        ],\n        \"medications\": [\n            \"Aspirin: 325 mg, oral\",\n            \"Nitroglycerin: 0.4 mg, sublingual\",\n            \"Morphine: 2-4 mg, intravenous (for refractory pain)\",\n            \"Omeprazole: 20 mg, oral daily (if GERD suspected)\"\n        ],\n        \"consultations\": [\n            \"Cardiology: immediate\",\n            \"Gastroenterology: routine (if GERD suspected)\"\n        ]\n    },\n    \"red_flags\": [\n        \"Chest pain with syncope or hypotension\",\n        \"Pain radiating to jaw/left arm\",\n        \"Diaphoresis or dyspnea\",\n        \"Hemodynamic instability\"\n    ]\n}\n```",
