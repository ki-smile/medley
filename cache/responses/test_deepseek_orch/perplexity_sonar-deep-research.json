  "content": "This is a medical case about a 45-year-old presenting with chest pain. The user is asking me to return ONLY valid JSON with a specific format. Let me analyze based on the search results provided.\n\nFrom the search results, I can see several important points about chest pain evaluation:\n\n1. Initial evaluation should include history, physical exam, and ECG\n2. Must rule out life-threatening causes first\n3. Key red flags include sudden onset, severe pain, radiation to arms/jaw, associated symptoms like diaphoresis, nausea, shortness of breath\n4. Major differential diagnoses include:\n   - Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) - including STEMI and NSTEMI\n   - Pulmonary embolism \n   - Aortic dissection\n   - Pneumothorax\n   - Pericarditis\n   - GERD\n   - Musculoskeletal pain\n\nHowever, the case is very limited - just \"45-year-old presents with chest pain\" with no other details about symptoms, vital signs, exam findings, etc. This makes it challenging to give a specific primary diagnosis.\n\nGiven the limited information and the fact that chest pain is a high-risk chief complaint, the approach should be to:\n1. Consider ACS as primary concern given age and presentation\n2. Include other life-threatening causes in differential\n3. Order immediate tests to rule out emergencies\n4. Provide appropriate immediate management\n\nLet me structure this according to the JSON format requested:\n\nPrimary diagnosis: Given the limited information and the need to assume worst-case scenario in chest pain, I should consider acute coronary syndrome as the primary concern, but with moderate confidence given lack of details.\n\nDifferential diagnoses should include the major life-threatening causes:\n- Acute coronary syndrome \n- Pulmonary embolism\n- Aortic dissection\n- Pericarditis\n- GERD\n\nTests should prioritize immediate life-threatening causes:\n- ECG (immediate)\n\n\n- Troponin and basic labs help quickly assess cardiac risk\n- Chest X-ray provides critical information about potential pulmonary issues\n- Immediate diagnostic workup crucial for ruling out serious conditions\n\nI'll focus on rapid assessment and management to ensure patient safety given the high-risk presentation.\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\n    \"primary_diagnosis\": {\n        \"name\": \"Acute coronary syndrome, unspecified\",\n        \"confidence\": 0.6,\n        \"icd_code\": \"I20.9\"\n    },\n    \"differential_diagnoses\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Unstable angina\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.7,\n            \"icd_code\": \"I20.0\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Pulmonary embolism\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.4,\n            \"icd_code\": \"I26.9\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Aortic dissection\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.3,\n            \"icd_code\": \"I71.00\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Acute pericarditis\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.3,\n            \"icd_code\": \"I30.9\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Gastroesophageal reflux disease\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.5,\n            \"icd_code\": \"K21.9\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"key_findings\": [\n        \"45-year-old with chest pain\",\n        \"High-risk age group for coronary artery disease\",\n        \"Limited clinical information available\"\n    ],\n    \"tests\": [\n        {\n            \"test\": \"12-lead ECG\",\n            \"priority\": \"immediate\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Cardiac troponin\",\n            \"priority\": \"immediate\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Chest X-ray\",\n            \"priority\": \"immediate\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Complete blood count\",\n            \"priority\": \"urgent\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Basic metabolic panel\",\n            \"priority\": \"urgent\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"D-dimer\",\n            \"priority\": \"urgent\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"management\": {\n        \"immediate\": [\n            \"ABC assessment and vital signs\",\n            \"Establish IV access\",\n            \"Continuous cardiac monitoring\",\n            \"Oxygen saturation monitoring\"\n        ],\n        \"medications\": [\n            \"Aspirin: 325mg PO once if no contraindications\",\n            \"Nitroglycerin: 0.4mg SL PRN chest pain\",\n            \"Morphine: 2-4mg IV q15min PRN severe pain\"\n        ],\n        \"consultations\": [\n            \"Cardiology: urgent if ACS suspected\",\n            \"Emergency medicine: immediate\"\n        ]\n    },\n    \"red_flags\": [\n        \"Sudden onset severe pain\",\n        \"Radiation to arm, jaw, or back\",\n        \"Associated diaphoresis or nausea\",\n        \"Shortness of breath\",\n        \"Hemodynamic instability\",\n        \"New murmur or S3 gallop\"\n    ]\n}\n```",
