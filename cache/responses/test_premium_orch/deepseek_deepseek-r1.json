  "content": "Okay, let's tackle this medical case. The patient is a 50-year-old with severe chest pain. My first thought is to consider life-threatening causes because chest pain can be critical. The primary diagnosis is likely acute myocardial infarction (heart attack). I need to check the ICD-10 code for that, which is I21.9. Confidence might be around 0.8 since there are other possibilities.\n\nFor differentials, unstable angina comes next. The ICD-10 is I20.0. Confidence maybe 0.7. Then pulmonary embolism (I26.9) with confidence 0.65. Aortic dissection, ICD-70, maybe 0.6. And maybe gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), K21.9, but lower confidence, like 0.3.\n\nKey findings should include age, sudden onset, and severity. Tests: immediate ECG and troponin, urgent CXR and D-dimer, then routine things like lipid profile. Management: immediate aspirin and nitroglycerin, oxygen if needed. Medications like aspirin 325 mg chewable, nitroglycerin 0.4 mg sublingual. Consult cardiology immediately. Red flags are pain radiating to jaw or arm, hypotension, etc.\n\nWait, need to make sure the doses are correct. Aspirin is indeed 325 mg. Nitro 0.4 mg SL every 5 minutes. For PE, anticoagulants like heparin, but in management, maybe list enoxaparin 1 mg/kg SC. Also, consultations: cardiology immediate, maybe vascular for aortic dissection.\n\nCheck differentials again. Include PE and aortic dissection as higher risk. GERD is less urgent. Test priorities: ECG and troponin are immediate. CXR and D-dimer urgent. Echo could be urgent too. Red flags like syncope or hypotension. Need to structure all into the JSON properly. Make sure ICD codes are right. Confidence numbers should sum up but not overlap too much. Okay, that should cover it.\n\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\n    \"primary_diagnosis\": {\n        \"name\": \"Acute Myocardial Infarction\",\n        \"confidence\": 0.8,\n        \"icd_code\": \"I21.9\"\n    },\n    \"differential_diagnoses\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Unstable Angina\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.7,\n            \"icd_code\": \"I20.0\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Pulmonary Embolism\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.65,\n            \"icd_code\": \"I26.9\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Aortic Dissection\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.6,\n            \"icd_code\": \"I71.0\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.3,\n            \"icd_code\": \"K21.9\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"key_findings\": [\n        \"Age \u226550 years\",\n        \"Sudden-onset severe chest pain\",\n        \"High risk for cardiovascular disease\"\n    ],\n    \"tests\": [\n        {\n            \"test\": \"12-lead ECG\",\n            \"priority\": \"immediate\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Cardiac Troponin\",\n            \"priority\": \"immediate\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Chest X-ray\",\n            \"priority\": \"urgent\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"D-dimer\",\n            \"priority\": \"urgent\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Echocardiogram\",\n            \"priority\": \"urgent\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"management\": {\n        \"immediate\": [\n            \"Aspirin administration\",\n            \"Nitroglycerin sublingual\",\n            \"Oxygen if hypoxic\"\n        ],\n        \"medications\": [\n            \"Aspirin: 325 mg chewable, oral\",\n            \"Nitroglycerin: 0.4 mg every 5 minutes (max 3 doses), sublingual\",\n            \"Morphine: 2-4 mg IV (if pain unresponsive to nitroglycerin)\",\n            \"Enoxaparin: 1 mg/kg SC (if pulmonary embolism suspected)\"\n        ],\n        \"consultations\": [\n            \"Cardiology: immediate\",\n            \"Vascular Surgery: urgent (if aortic dissection suspected)\"\n        ]\n    },\n    \"red_flags\": [\n        \"Pain radiating to jaw/left arm\",\n        \"Hypotension (SBP <90 mmHg)\",\n        \"Diaphoresis\",\n        \"Syncope\",\n        \"Neurologic deficits (aortic dissection)\"\n    ]\n}\n```",
