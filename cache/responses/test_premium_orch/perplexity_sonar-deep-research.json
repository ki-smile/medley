  "content": "I need to analyze this medical case of a 50-year-old patient presenting with severe chest pain and return a structured JSON response based on the search results provided.\n\nLet me break down what information I have from the search results:\n\n1. From [1] - Six life-threatening causes of pleuritic chest pain: Pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, pericarditis, aortic dissection, pneumonia, and pneumothorax\n\n2. From [4] - A differential diagnosis table for a 50-year-old with hypertension and diabetes who smokes, showing:\n   - Acute coronary syndrome: 40% pre-test probability\n   - ST-segment elevation MI: 20% pre-test probability  \n   - Chest wall pain: 30% pre-test probability\n   - Pulmonary embolism: 5% pre-test probability\n   - Dissecting thoracic aortic aneurysm: <3% pre-test probability\n   - Spontaneous pneumothorax: <2% pre-test probability\n\n3. From [6] - Assessment should begin with ABC's, ECG and rapid diagnostics\n\n4. From [25] - Red flag features include sudden onset, exertional chest pain, substernal or left-sided pain, radiation to left arm/jaw/back, crushing/pressure/tearing quality\n\n5. From [3] - NICE guidelines recommend ECG within 10 minutes, 90% of chest pain patients should have aspirin and ECG within 10 minutes\n\n6. Various ICD-10 codes from the search results:\n   - I21: Acute myocardial infarction\n   - I20.0: Unstable angina\n   - I24.9: Acute ischemic heart disease, unspecified\n   - I26: Pulmonary embolism\n   - I71: Aortic aneurysm and dissection\n   - J93.9: Pneumothorax, unspecified\n   - I30: Acute pericarditis\n   - R07.9: Chest pain, unspecified\n\n7. From [28] - Five warning signs of serious chest pain including sudden severe pain, gradually building pain, chest pain with other symptoms, radiating pain, pain that doesn't improve\n\n8. From [23] and [26] - Treatment includes aspirin 160-325mg and nitroglycerin for suspected ACS\n\nI'll prioritize acute coronary syndrome as the primary diagnosis, with a 40% pre-test probability. The patient's age, risk factors, and severe chest pain symptoms strongly suggest cardiac origin. Immediate management requires rapid ECG, cardiac markers, and initial treatment with aspirin and nitroglycerin while preparing for potential emergency intervention.\n\nManagement will include stabilizing the patient, ruling out life-threatening conditions through targeted diagnostic testing and careful clinical assessment.\n\nImmediate interventions focus on oxygen support, establishing IV access, administering aspirin and nitroglycerin, and securing an urgent cardiology consultation to evaluate potential acute cardiac events.\n\nCritical red flags include sudden onset of severe chest pain, which demands rapid diagnostic and therapeutic response to prevent potential myocardial infarction or other serious cardiovascular complications.\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\n    \"primary_diagnosis\": {\n        \"name\": \"Acute Coronary Syndrome\",\n        \"confidence\": 0.75,\n        \"icd_code\": \"I24.9\"\n    },\n    \"differential_diagnoses\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI)\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.65,\n            \"icd_code\": \"I21.3\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Non-ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI)\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.60,\n            \"icd_code\": \"I21.4\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Pulmonary Embolism\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.35,\n            \"icd_code\": \"I26.9\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Aortic Dissection\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.25,\n            \"icd_code\": \"I71.00\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Pneumothorax\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.20,\n            \"icd_code\": \"J93.9\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"key_findings\": [\n        \"50-year-old patient\",\n        \"Severe chest pain\",\n        \"High-risk age group for coronary artery disease\"\n    ],\n    \"tests\": [\n        {\n            \"test\": \"12-lead ECG\",\n            \"priority\": \"immediate\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Troponin I/T\",\n            \"priority\": \"immediate\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Chest X-ray\",\n            \"priority\": \"immediate\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Complete Blood Count\",\n            \"priority\": \"urgent\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Basic Metabolic Panel\",\n            \"priority\": \"urgent\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"PT/PTT/INR\",\n            \"priority\": \"urgent\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"management\": {\n        \"immediate\": [\n            \"IV access\",\n            \"Continuous cardiac monitoring\",\n            \"Oxygen saturation monitoring\",\n            \"Vital signs every 15 minutes\",\n            \"NPO status\"\n        ],\n        \"medications\": [\n            \"Aspirin: 325mg chewed, then 81mg daily PO\",\n            \"Nitroglycerin: 0.4mg sublingual every 5 minutes x3 PRN chest pain\",\n            \"Atorvastatin: 80mg daily PO\",\n            \"Metoprolol: 25mg BID PO if no contraindications\"\n        ],\n        \"consultations\": [\n            \"Cardiology: immediate\",\n            \"Interventional Cardiology: immediate if STEMI confirmed\"\n        ]\n    },\n    \"red_flags\": [\n        \"Sudden onset severe chest pain\",\n        \"Age 50 - increased risk for coronary artery disease\",\n        \"Potential for hemodynamic instability\",\n        \"Risk of cardiac arrest\",\n        \"Need for emergent reperfusion therapy\"\n    ]\n}\n```",
