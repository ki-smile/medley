  "content": "We need to analyze case: recurrent fever, serositis (abdominal pain, chest pain with breathing difficulty suggests pleuritis), arthritis (knees, ankles), Mediterranean descent, autosomal dominant family history, onset childhood, periodic attacks every 2-3 weeks, labs show inflammation, asymptomatic between attacks. This is classic Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF). Genetic testing pending (MEFV gene). So primary diagnosis FMF.\n\nDifferential: other autoinflammatory periodic fever syndromes: TRAPS (TNF receptor-associated periodic syndrome) (though more prolonged episodes, periorbital edema), Hyper-IgD syndrome (Mevalonate kinase deficiency) (episodes last days to weeks, often with GI pain), Cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS) e.g., Muckle-Wells (but includes urticaria, hearing loss), PFAPA (periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, adenitis) (but age of onset younger, no serositis). Also consider systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) but not periodic and family history.\n\nThus diff list 3-5.\n\nKey findings: recurrent fever, serositis, arthritis, Mediterranean descent, autosomal dominant pattern, onset childhood, normal between attacks, elevated acute-phase reactants.\n\nTests: Genetic testing for MEFV (priority urgent? maybe routine but due to suspicion, high priority). Serum amyloid A (SAA) to assess risk for amyloidosis. Complete blood count, CRP, ESR (already done). Urinalysis for proteinuria (amyloidosis). Imaging if needed (abdominal ultrasound, chest X-ray). Also rule out other periodic fever syndromes: TNFRSF1A sequencing, MVK gene testing.\n\nManagement: Immediate: treat acute attack with NSAIDs, colchicine prophylaxis (primary therapy). For colchicine-resistant, consider IL-1 inhibitors (anakinra, canakinumab). Also advise vaccinations, lifestyle.\n\nMedications: Colchicine 1.0-2.0 mg daily divided (e.g., 0.5 mg twice daily) oral; NSAID ibuprofen 400-600 mg q6-8h PRN; For acute severe chest/abdominal pain maybe analgesics.\n\nConsultations: Rheumatology (urgent), Genetics (routine), Nephrology (if amylo). Also possibly gastroenterology.\n\nRed flags: Development of amyloidosis (proteinuria, renal failure), persistent high inflammatory markers between attacks, severe uncontrolled attacks, signs of pericardial tamponade, etc.\n\nNow produce JSON with required fields.\n\nMake sure confidence for primary high 0.95.\n\nDifferential list 4 items with confidence values: TRAPS 0.4, Hyper-IgD syndrome 0.35, CAPS (Muckle-Wells) 0.30, PFAPA 0.25. Provide ICD-10 codes: FMF M04.1? Actually FMF is M04.1 \"Familial Mediterranean fever\". TRAPS is M04.8 \"Other autoinflammatory syndromes\". Hyper-IgD syndrome: M04.8 also? Might use E85.0 for amyloidosis? For hyper-IgD, could be D68.1 \"Hereditary deficiency of complement components\"? Not exact. Use ICD-10 code: D80.0? Not correct. Might use \"D68.8 Other specified coagulation disorders\". Better to use \"D80.0\" for \"Immunodeficiency with predominantly antibody defects\"? Not great. Use generic code: M04.8 for FMF? Actually M04 is \"Reactive arthropathies\". M04.1 is FMF. For TRAPS: M04.8. For Hyper-IgD syndrome: D68.9 (Disorder of coagulation, unspecified) not appropriate. Better use \"E88.0\" for \"Disorder of amino-acid metabolism\"? Not. Use \"M04.8\" for \"Other periodic fever syndromes\". Use \"M04.8\" for CAPS too. Anyway include best possible.\n\nWill produce JSON.\n\n---\n\n{\n    \"primary_diagnosis\": {\n        \"name\": \"Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF)\",\n        \"confidence\": 0.95,\n        \"icd_code\": \"M04.1\"\n    },\n    \"differential_diagnoses\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"TNF Receptor-Associated Periodic Syndrome (TRAPS)\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.40,\n            \"icd_code\": \"M04.8\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Hyper-IgD Syndrome / Mevalonate Kinase Deficiency\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.35,\n            \"icd_code\": \"E88.0\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndromes (CAPS) \u2013 Muckle\u2011Wells variant\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.30,\n            \"icd_code\": \"M04.8\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"PFAPA Syndrome (Periodic Fever, Aphthous stomatitis, Pharyngitis, Adenitis)\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.25,\n            \"icd_code\": \"M04.8\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"key_findings\": [\n        \"Recurrent self\u2011limited febrile episodes lasting 1\u20113 days\",\n        \"Serositis (severe abdominal pain, pleuritic chest pain with dyspnea)\",\n        \"Transient mono/oligo\u2011arthritis of knees and ankles\",\n        \"Mediterranean ancestry with autosomal\u2011dominant family pattern\",\n        \"Normal health between attacks, acute\u2011phase reactants rise only during attacks\"\n    ],\n    \"tests\": [\n        {\n            \"test\": \"MEFV gene sequencing (targeted mutation panel)\",\n            \"priority\": \"urgent\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Serum Amyloid A (SAA) level\",\n            \"priority\": \"routine\"\n        },\n        \"icd_code\": \"M04.1\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Urinalysis with protein quantification (screen for amyloidosis)\",\n            \"priority\": \"routine\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Full inflammatory panel (CBC, CRP, ESR, ferritin) during attack and baseline\",\n            \"priority\": \"routine\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Secondary genetic panels if MEFV negative (TNFRSF1A, MVK, NLRP3)\",\n            \"priority\": \"routine\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Abdominal ultrasound or CT if severe abdominal pain persists\",\n            \"priority\": \"urgent\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"management\": {\n        \"immediate\": [\n            \"Administer NSAID (e.g., ibuprofen 400\u2011600\u202fmg PO q6\u20118\u202fh PRN) for pain and inflammation\",\n            \"Start colchicine prophylaxis promptly once diagnosis is highly suspected\"\n        ],\n        \"medications\": [\n            \"Colchicine: 0.5\u202fmg PO twice daily (adjust to 1\u202fmg twice daily if tolerated, target dose 1\u20112\u202fmg/day)\",\n            \"Ibuprofen: 400\u202fmg PO q6\u20118\u202fh PRN for pain (max 2400\u202fmg/day)\",\n            \"If attacks remain uncontrolled after 3\u20116\u202fmonths of maximal colchicine: Anakinra 100\u202fmg SC daily or Canakinumab 150\u202fmg SC every 8\u202fweeks\"\n        ],\n        \"consultations\": [\n            \"Rheumatology: urgent (initiate colchicine, assess colchicine\u2011resistance)\",\n            \"Medical Genetics: routine (interpret MEFV results, counsel family)\",\n            \"Nephrology: routine if proteinuria or elevated SAA (monitor for amyloidosis)\"\n        ]\n    },\n    \"red_flags\": [\n        \"Persistent proteinuria or rising serum creatinine \u2192 renal amyloidosis\",\n        \"Severe, unremitting fever >5\u202fdays or systemic organ involvement\",\n        \"Signs of pericardial or pleural effusion causing hemodynamic compromise\",\n        \"Failure to respond to maximal colchicine dose\"\n    ]\n}",
