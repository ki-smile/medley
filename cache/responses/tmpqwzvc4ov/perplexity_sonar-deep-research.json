  "content": "Let me analyze this medical case step by step based on the search results provided.\n\n**Case Analysis:**\n\n28-year-old male of Mediterranean descent with:\n- Recurrent episodes of fever lasting 1-3 days\n- Severe abdominal pain during episodes  \n- Chest pain with breathing difficulties\n- Joint pain affecting knees and ankles\n- Family history: Father and paternal uncle have similar symptoms\n- Episodes occur every 2-3 weeks\n- Labs during attack: Elevated CRP, ESR, and WBC\n- Between attacks: Completely asymptomatic\n- Episodes started in childhood around age 7\n- Genetic testing is pending\n\n**Primary Diagnosis Analysis:**\n\nThis presentation is highly suggestive of **Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF)**. Let me check the key features:\n\nFrom the search results, FMF characteristics include:\n1. Mediterranean ancestry (patient is of Mediterranean descent) \u2713\n2. Recurrent fever episodes lasting 1-3 days (patient has 1-3 day episodes) \u2713\n3. Severe abdominal pain (patient has severe abdominal pain) \u2713\n4. Chest pain (patient has chest pain with breathing difficulties) \u2713\n5. Joint pain, commonly knees and ankles (patient has knee and ankle pain) \u2713\n6. Family history (father and paternal uncle affected) \u2713\n7. Episodes start in childhood (started at age 7) \u2713\n8. Symptom-free between attacks (completely asymptomatic between) \u2713\n9. Elevated inflammatory markers during attacks (elevated CRP, ESR, WBC) \u2713\n\nThe ICD-10 code for FMF is M04.1 (Periodic fever syndromes, which includes Familial Mediterranean fever).\n\n**Differential Diagnoses:**\n\n1. **TRAPS (Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome)**\n   - Also causes periodic fever, chest pain, abdominal pain\n   - Longer episode duration of 1-3 weeks\n   - Potential genetic inheritance pattern\n\n2. **HIDS (Hyperimmunoglobulinemia D syndrome)**\n   - Periodic fever syndrome with shorter episodes of 3-7 days\n   - Presents with abdominal and joint pain\n   - Typically begins in early childhood\n   - Shares similar diagnostic code\n\n3. **Adult-onset Still's disease**\n   - Characterized by persistent fever patterns\n   - Involves joint and chest pain manifestations\n   - Different clinical presentation from current case\n\n4. **PFAPA syndrome**\n   - Periodic fever syndrome with distinct clinical markers\n   - Early childhood onset\n   - Recurring episodes at regular intervals\n   - Specific inflammatory pattern\n\n**Key Observations:**\n- Mediterranean genetic background suggests familial transmission\n- Recurrent short febrile episodes\n- Significant systemic inflammatory symptoms\n- Childhood emergence of condition\n- Intermittent symptomatic periods\n\n**Diagnostic Approach:**\nFocused investigation needed to confirm underlying inflammatory mechanism\n\n. Genetic and inflammatory markers provide critical insights into disease progression and potential management strategies.\n\n**Management Considerations:**\nTargeted treatment requires careful monitoring of inflammatory responses and potential long-term complications. Individualized therapeutic approach essential for managing periodic inflammatory episodes.\n\n**Key Clinical Warnings:**\nVigilant tracking of renal function and protein markers crucial to prevent irreversible systemic damage. Potential for significant organ involvement necessitates proactive surveillance.\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\n    \"primary_diagnosis\": {\n        \"name\": \"Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF)\",\n        \"confidence\": 0.95,\n        \"icd_code\": \"M04.1\"\n    },\n    \"differential_diagnoses\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS)\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.15,\n            \"icd_code\": \"M04.1\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Hyperimmunoglobulinemia D syndrome (HIDS)\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.10,\n            \"icd_code\": \"M04.1\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Adult-onset Still's disease\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.08,\n            \"icd_code\": \"M06.1\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"PFAPA syndrome\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.05,\n            \"icd_code\": \"M04.1\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"key_findings\": [\n        \"Mediterranean ancestry with strong family history\",\n        \"Recurrent 1-3 day febrile episodes since childhood\",\n        \"Classic triad: fever, severe abdominal pain, chest pain\",\n        \"Joint involvement of knees and ankles\",\n        \"Complete symptom-free intervals between attacks\",\n        \"Elevated inflammatory markers during episodes\"\n    ],\n    \"tests\": [\n        {\n            \"test\": \"MEFV gene mutation analysis\",\n            \"priority\": \"immediate\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Serum amyloid A (SAA) levels\",\n            \"priority\": \"urgent\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"CBC, CRP, ESR during attack and remission\",\n            \"priority\": \"urgent\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Comprehensive metabolic panel with liver function\",\n            \"priority\": \"routine\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Urinalysis with microscopy and proteinuria assessment\",\n            \"priority\": \"routine\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"management\": {\n        \"immediate\": [\n            \"Symptomatic management during acute episode\",\n            \"Pain control with NSAIDs\",\n            \"Patient education about FMF\"\n        ],\n        \"medications\": [\n            \"Colchicine: 0.6 mg orally twice daily initially, may increase to 1.2-2.4 mg daily as tolerated\"\n        ],\n        \"consultations\": [\n            \"Rheumatology: urgent\",\n            \"Medical genetics: routine\"\n        ]\n    },\n    \"red_flags\": [\n        \"Development of proteinuria (amyloidosis risk)\",\n        \"Persistent elevated SAA levels despite treatment\",\n        \"Kidney dysfunction or declining GFR\",\n        \"More frequent or severe episodes\",\n        \"Poor response to colchicine therapy\"\n    ]\n}\n```",
