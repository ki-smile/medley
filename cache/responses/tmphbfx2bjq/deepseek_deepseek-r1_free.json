  "content": "Okay, let's tackle this medical case. The patient is a 28-year-old male of Mediterranean descent with recurrent fever episodes, abdominal pain, chest pain, joint pain, and a family history of similar symptoms in his father and uncle. The episodes last 1-3 days, occur every 2-3 weeks, started in childhood, and lab results during attacks show elevated CRP, ESR, and WBC. He's asymptomatic between episodes. Genetic testing is pending.\n\nFirst, considering the recurrent fevers and family history, Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) comes to mind. FMF is common in Mediterranean populations, presents with episodic fever, abdominal pain, chest pain (pleuritis), arthritis, and elevated inflammatory markers. The autosomal recessive inheritance fits the family history. Since genetic testing is pending, but the clinical picture fits, I'd put high confidence here. ICD-10 code E85.0.\n\nDifferential diagnoses: \n\n1. Periodic Fever Syndromes: Maybe Hyper-IgD syndrome (HIDS), but HIDS typically has longer episodes and more associated symptoms like vomiting, diarrhea. Lower confidence. ICD-10 E85.8.\n\n2. Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (SJIA): Can cause periodic fever, joint pain, but usually more persistent symptoms and rash. But SJIA might have different lab patterns. ICD-10 M08.2.\n\n3. Adult-Onset Still\u2019s Disease (AOSD): Similar to SJIA, but age might be a factor. However, patient's episodes started in childhood. ICD-10 M06.1.\n\n4. Gout: Though joint pain is in knees and ankles, but age is young and Mediterranean descent less commonly associated. Maybe pseudogout? But not sure. Maybe lower confidence. ICD-10 M10.9.\n\nKey findings would include the recurrent episodic symptoms, family history, Mediterranean descent, elevated inflammatory markers during attacks, and asymptomatic periods.\n\nTests needed: Confirm FMF with genetic testing (MEFV gene), prioritize that as urgent. Also, during attacks, check SAA (serum amyloid A) for amyloidosis risk. Routine CBC, CRP, ESR. Maybe synovial fluid analysis if joint swelling is present.\n\nManagement: Immediate during attacks could be supportive care. Colchicine is mainstay for prophylaxis, so start colchicine 0.6 mg twice daily. NSAIDs for pain. Consult rheumatology urgently. Also, genetic counseling.\n\nRed flags would be signs of amyloidosis (proteinuria), severe organ involvement, or if symptoms don't respond to colchicine.\n\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\n    \"primary_diagnosis\": {\n        \"name\": \"Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF)\",\n        \"confidence\": 0.9,\n        \"icd_code\": \"E85.0\"\n    },\n    \"differential_diagnoses\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Hyperimmunoglobulin D Syndrome (HIDS)\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.3,\n            \"icd_code\": \"E85.8\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (SJIA)\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.25,\n            \"icd_code\": \"M08.2\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Adult-Onset Still\u2019s Disease (AOSD)\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.2,\n            \"icd_code\": \"M06.1\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"key_findings\": [\n        \"Recurrent self-limiting fever episodes since childhood\",\n        \"Mediterranean descent with family history of similar symptoms\",\n        \"Abdominal, chest, and joint pain during attacks\",\n        \"Elevated CRP/ESR/WBC during flares\",\n        \"Asymptomatic between episodes\"\n    ],\n    \"tests\": [\n        {\n            \"test\": \"MEFV gene sequencing (confirm FMF)\",\n            \"priority\": \"urgent\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Serum amyloid A (SAA)\",\n            \"priority\": \"urgent\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"IL-1\u03b2 levels (if HIDS/SJIA suspected)\",\n            \"priority\": \"routine\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Urinalysis (assess for proteinuria)\",\n            \"priority\": \"immediate\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"management\": {\n        \"immediate\": [\"Analgesia for pain\", \"Hydration support\"],\n        \"medications\": [\n            \"colchicine: 0.6 mg PO twice daily (prophylaxis)\",\n            \"ibuprofen: 400-600 mg PO every 6 hours (as needed for pain)\"\n        ],\n        \"consultations\": [\n            \"rheumatology: urgent\",\n            \"genetic counseling: routine\"\n        ]\n    },\n    \"red_flags\": [\n        \"Persistent fever >7 days\",\n        \"New-onset proteinuria (amyloidosis risk)\",\n        \"Signs of pericarditis or pleuritis\",\n        \"Unresponsive to colchicine therapy\"\n    ]\n}\n```",
