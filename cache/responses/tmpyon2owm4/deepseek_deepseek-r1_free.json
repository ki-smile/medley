  "content": "Okay, let's tackle this medical case. The patient is a 28-year-old male of Mediterranean descent with recurrent fever episodes, abdominal pain, chest pain with breathing difficulties, and joint pain in knees and ankles. The episodes last 1-3 days and occur every 2-3 weeks. Family history includes father and paternal uncle with similar symptoms. Labs during attacks show elevated CRP, ESR, and WBC. He's asymptomatic between episodes, and symptoms started in childhood. Genetic testing is pending.\n\nFirst, the Mediterranean background and family history make me think of Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF). FMF presents with recurrent fevers, serositis (abdominal, chest pain), arthritis, and elevated inflammatory markers. The autosomal recessive inheritance fits the family history here. The ICD-10 is E85.0. Confidence is high, maybe 0.9, but need to wait for genetic testing to confirm.\n\nDifferential diagnoses: Periodic Fever Syndromes. Hmm. TRAPS (TNF Receptor-Associated Periodic Syndrome) is another autoinflammatory disorder. Symptoms are similar but episodes last longer than a week. ICD-10 D89.8. Confidence maybe 0.3. Then Beh\u00e7et's disease: recurrent oral ulcers, but he doesn't mention that. Lower confidence, like 0.2. Muckle-Wells syndrome (Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndromes) also has recurrent fevers and joint pain, but often with rash and hearing loss. ICD-10 L50.8, confidence 0.15. Maybe acute intermittent porphyria? It causes abdominal pain and can have neuro symptoms, but the episodic nature here might not fit as well. Less likely, confidence 0.1.\n\nKey findings: Mediterranean descent, recurrent self-limiting fever episodes, family history, serositis symptoms (abdominal, chest pain), elevated inflammatory markers during attacks, asymptomatic between episodes.\n\nTests: Genetic testing for MEFV mutations is crucial. Priority immediate. Also, serum amyloid A (SAA) to assess for amyloidosis, which is a complication of FMF. Urgent. Maybe IL-1 levels for other periodic fevers, but routine. For porphyria, urine PBG during an attack, urgent. C-reactive protein and ESR are already done but might need monitoring.\n\nImmediate management: Supportive care during attacks\u2014NSAIDs for pain and inflammation. Colchicine is the mainstay for FMF prophylaxis, so start colchicine 1.2 mg daily. If attacks continue, consider IL-1 inhibitors like anakinra. Consult rheumatology urgently and genetics for confirmatory testing. Red flags would be signs of amyloidosis (proteinuria, renal dysfunction), pleuritis complications, or severe unrelenting pain.\n\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\n    \"primary_diagnosis\": {\n        \"name\": \"Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF)\",\n        \"confidence\": 0.9,\n        \"icd_code\": \"E85.0\"\n    },\n    \"differential_diagnoses\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"TNF Receptor-Associated Periodic Syndrome (TRAPS)\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.3,\n            \"icd_code\": \"D89.8\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Beh\u00e7et\u2019s Disease\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.2,\n            \"icd_code\": \"M35.2\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Muckle-Wells Syndrome (Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndrome)\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.15,\n            \"icd_code\": \"L50.8\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Acute Intermittent Porphyria\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.1,\n            \"icd_code\": \"E80.21\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"key_findings\": [\n        \"Recurrent self-limiting fever episodes (1-3 days)\",\n        \"Serositis (abdominal pain, pleuritic chest pain)\",\n        \"Oligoarthritis (knees/ankles)\",\n        \"Mediterranean descent with positive family history\",\n        \"Elevated CRP, ESR, and WBC during attacks\",\n        \"Asymptomatic between episodes\"\n    ],\n    \"tests\": [\n        {\n            \"test\": \"MEFV gene sequencing\",\n            \"priority\": \"immediate\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Serum amyloid A (SAA)\",\n            \"priority\": \"urgent\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Urine porphobilinogen (PBG) during attack\",\n            \"priority\": \"urgent\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"IL-1\u03b2 and TNF levels\",\n            \"priority\": \"routine\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"management\": {\n        \"immediate\": [\n            \"Symptomatic relief with NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen 600 mg oral every 6 hours as needed)\",\n            \"Monitor for signs of serositis complications (e.g., peritoneal signs, pleural effusion)\"\n        ],\n        \"medications\": [\n            \"colchicine: 1.2 mg oral daily (prophylaxis)\",\n            \"anakinra: 100 mg subcutaneous daily (if colchicine-resistant)\"\n        ],\n        \"consultations\": [\n            \"Rheumatology: urgent\",\n            \"Clinical Genetics: urgent\"\n        ]\n    },\n    \"red_flags\": [\n        \"Persistent fever >7 days\",\n        \"Proteinuria or renal dysfunction (amyloidosis)\",\n        \"Neurologic symptoms (seizures, confusion)\",\n        \"Signs of pericarditis or tamponade\"\n    ]\n}\n```",
