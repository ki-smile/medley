  "content": "We need to output a JSON object only. Provide primary diagnosis likely Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) but she is Somali (East African). FMF more common in Mediterranean, but other autoinflammatory syndromes like hereditary periodic fever syndromes (e.g., TNF receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS), Hyper IgD syndrome). However peritoneal signs, fever, arthritis, recurrent episodes, family history suggests autoinflammatory periodic fever syndrome. In Somali, could be PFAPA? Not typical. Could be acute bacterial peritonitis but recurrent episodes, family history suggests genetic. So primary: Familial Mediterranean Fever (ICD-10: M04.1). Confidence maybe 0.7.\n\nDifferentials: 1) Acute bacterial peritonitis/appendicitis (K35) 2) Septic arthritis/osteomyelitis (M00) 3) Inflammatory bowel disease with extraintestinal manifestations (Crohn's disease) (K50). Also consider Tuberculosis peritonitis (A15.0). Provide at least 3 diff.\n\nProvide key findings: recurrent serositis (peritoneal), fever >39\u00b0C, arthritis, family history.\n\nDiagnostic tests: Serum amyloid A, CRP (already), ESR, Genetic testing for MEFV mutations, abdominal ultrasound/CT, blood cultures, urine analysis, fecal calprotectin, colonoscopy if IBD suspicion. Priorities: immediate labs, imaging, genetic test.\n\nManagement: immediate: IV fluids, analgesia, consider colchicine for FMF. Also treat pain, monitor vitals. Medications: colchicine 0.6 mg PO daily, NSAID for pain, empiric antibiotics if infection not ruled out? But primary treat FMF.\n\nMonitoring: vitals, pain, labs (CRP), renal function (colchicine). Consult: Rheumatology (urgent), Infectious disease (if infection), Gastroenterology (if IBD suspicion). Red flags: signs of perforation, sepsis, persistent high fever >5 days, new neurologic signs, severe abdominal distension.\n\nPatient education: importance of colchicine adherence, genetic nature, trigger avoidance, when to seek care.\n\nFollow up: 1-2 weeks after discharge, sooner if worsening.\n\nConfidence overall maybe 0.75. Uncertainties: exact genetic diagnosis, possibility of infection, cultural factors affecting compliance.\n\nNow produce JSON accordingly. Ensure correct syntax, no extra text.\n\n\n\n---\n\n{\n    \"primary_diagnosis\": {\n        \"name\": \"Familial Mediterranean Fever (autoinflammatory periodic fever syndrome)\",\n        \"confidence\": 0.73,\n        \"icd_code\": \"M04.1\",\n        \"reasoning\": \"Recurrent self\u2011limited episodes of high fever, serositis (peritoneal signs), and migratory arthritis with a positive family history are classic for FMF, even though the patient is Somali;
