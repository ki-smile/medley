  "content": "The user requests a JSON object only, with detailed diagnostic assessment. Must follow format exactly. Need to avoid any extra text. Provide primary diagnosis likely: Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) but patient Somali (East African). However FMF is more common in Mediterranean, but there is a similar autoinflammatory disease: TNF receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS) or hereditary periodic fever syndromes. However recurrent episodes of serositis (abdominal pain), fever, arthritis suggests FMF. Also family history. Could be acute intermittent porphyria? That can cause abdominal pain, neuro symptoms, but not arthritis. Could be infectious: bacterial peritonitis? But episodes self-resolve, recurrent. Could be inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's) causing abdominal pain and arthritis. But peritoneal signs each episode and high fevers.\n\nGiven immigrant from Somalia, consider tuberculosis peritonitis? But episodes self-resolve.\n\nLikely diagnosis: Familial Mediterranean Fever (ICD-10: M04.1? Actually FMF is M04.1 \"Recurrent fever with serositis\"? Let's check: FMF code is M04.1 \"Recurrent fever with serositis\". Yes.\n\nProvide confidence maybe 0.75.\n\nDifferential: 1) Acute intermittent porphyria (ICD-10: E80.2). 2) Crohn disease (ICD-10: K50.90). 3) Infectious peritonitis/tuberculous peritonitis (ICD-10: A15.0? Actually TB peritoneum is A15.0? Might be A15.0 \"Tuberculosis of lung\"? Not correct. Use \"A19.0\" \"Miliary tuberculosis\"? Could use \"A15.0\"? Let's use \"A15.0\" for TB of lung? Not appropriate. Use \"A19.0\" for \"Miliary tuberculosis\" maybe. Better: \"A19.0\" is \"Miliary tuberculosis\". We'll note \"Tuberculous peritonitis\" code: \"A18.0\" (Tuberculosis of intestine). Actually A18 is TB of other organs. So \"A18.0\" for \"Tuberculosis of intestine\". Use that.\n\nAlso consider \"Systemic lupus erythematosus\" (M32.9). But less likely.\n\nProvide key findings: Recurrent high fever, serositis (abdominal pain), arthritis, family history, ethnic background.\n\nDiagnostic tests: Serum amyloid A and genetic testing for MEFV mutations, CBC, CRP, ESR already, abdominal ultrasound/CT, peritoneal fluid analysis, colonoscopy, HLA-B27? Not needed.\n\nManagement: Immediate colchicine, dose 0.6 mg PO BID, adjust. Pain control, NSAIDs, maybe steroids.\n\nMonitoring: CRP, renal function, colchicine toxicity.\n\nConsultations: Rheumatology urgent, Infectious disease for TB, Gastroenterology.\n\nRed flags: Persistent abdominal pain, signs of perforation, hemodynamic instability, rising creatinine.\n\nPatient education: Importance of adherence to colchicine, genetic counseling, recognize triggers.\n\nFollow-up: Rheumatology in 1-2 weeks, ED if worsening.\n\nConfidence in assessment: 0.78.\n\nUncertainties: Genetic confirmation, exclusion of TB, exact cause of arthritis.\n\nNow produce JSON with required fields.
