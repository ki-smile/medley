  "content": "Okay, let me tackle this medical case. The patient is a 28-year-old male of Mediterranean descent with recurrent fever episodes since childhood. The symptoms include severe abdominal pain, chest pain with breathing difficulties, joint pain in knees and ankles, and a family history of similar symptoms in his father and uncle. Labs during attacks show elevated CRP, ESR, and WBC. He's asymptomatic between episodes, which happen every 2-3 weeks.\n\nFirst, the Mediterranean descent makes me think of Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF). FMF is an autosomal recessive disorder common in that population. Symptoms like recurrent fever, serositis (abdominal and chest pain), arthritis fit. Family history supports hereditary condition. Elevated inflammatory markers during attacks are typical. The age of onset in childhood also aligns. So FMF is likely the primary diagnosis. ICD-10 code is E85.0.\n\nDifferential diagnoses? Maybe Periodic Fever Syndromes. Let's see... Hyper-IgD syndrome (HIDS) could be a possibility, but HIDS often has longer fever episodes and more prominent lymphadenopathy. The ICD-10 for HIDS is E85.1. Another differential is TNF receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS), which has longer fever episodes (weeks), but the family history here might fit as it's autosomal dominant. ICD-10 E85.2. Also, Beh\u00e7et's disease, but that usually includes oral ulcers, uveitis, which aren't mentioned here. ICD-10 M35.2. Maybe Adult-onset Still's disease, but that's more associated with quotidian fevers and rash. So those are the differentials.\n\nKey findings would be the recurrent fevers, family history, Mediterranean descent, serositis symptoms, elevated inflammatory markers during attacks, and asymptomatic periods.\n\nTests needed: The genetic testing for MEFV mutations (confirms FMF), priority immediate. Also, serum IgD and IgA levels for HIDS (urgent). Genetic testing for TNFRSF1A for TRAPS (urgent). CRP and ESR during attacks (routine now, but already done). Maybe a chest X-ray for pleural effusion (immediate if chest pain present).\n\nManagement: Immediate would be to manage acute attacks with NSAIDs for pain and inflammation. Colchicine is the mainstay for preventing attacks in FMF, so start colchicine 0.6 mg PO twice daily. If severe, maybe corticosteroids. Consult rheumatology urgently and genetics for confirmatory testing.\n\nRed flags would be signs of amyloidosis (complication of untreated FMF) like proteinuria, or if symptoms don't respond to colchicine. Also, if new symptoms like rashes or vision changes emerge, consider other differentials.\n\nCheck if all the required elements are covered. Primary diagnosis, differentials with ICD codes, tests with priorities, management steps, and red flags. Doses for meds like colchicine included. JSON structure as specified. Alright, let me put this into the format.\n\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\n    \"primary_diagnosis\": {\n        \"name\": \"Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF)\",\n        \"confidence\": 0.9,\n        \"icd_code\": \"E85.0\"\n    },\n    \"differential_diagnoses\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Hyperimmunoglobulin D Syndrome (HIDS)\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.5,\n            \"icd_code\": \"E85.1\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"TNF Receptor-Associated Periodic Syndrome (TRAPS)\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.4,\n            \"icd_code\": \"E85.2\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Adult-Onset Still's Disease\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.3,\n            \"icd_code\": \"M06.1\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"key_findings\": [\n        \"Recurrent self-limiting fever episodes\",\n        \"Mediterranean descent with family history of similar symptoms\",\n        \"Serositis (abdominal and chest pain)\",\n        \"Elevated CRP, ESR, and WBC during attacks\",\n        \"Asymptomatic between episodes\"\n    ],\n    \"tests\": [\n        {\n            \"test\": \"MEFV gene mutation analysis\",\n            \"priority\": \"immediate\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Serum IgD and IgA levels\",\n            \"priority\": \"urgent\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"TNFRSF1A gene testing for TRAPS\",\n            \"priority\": \"urgent\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Chest X-ray (to assess pleuritis)\",\n            \"priority\": \"immediate\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"management\": {\n        \"immediate\": [\n            \"Rule out acute surgical causes of abdominal pain\",\n            \"Monitor for signs of sepsis or organ dysfunction\"\n        ],\n        \"medications\": [\n            \"Colchicine: 0.6 mg PO twice daily (prophylaxis)\",\n            \"Ibuprofen: 400-600 mg PO every 6 hours PRN pain (during attacks)\"\n        ],\n        \"consultations\": [\n            \"Rheumatology: urgent\",\n            \"Clinical Genetics: routine\"\n        ]\n    },\n    \"red_flags\": [\n        \"Persistent fever >5 days\",\n        \"Neurologic symptoms (e.g., seizures)\",\n        \"Signs of amyloidosis (e.g., proteinuria)\",\n        \"Development of joint deformities\"\n    ]\n}\n```",
