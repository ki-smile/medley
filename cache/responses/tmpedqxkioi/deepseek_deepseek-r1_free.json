  "content": "Okay, let me try to figure out this case. The patient is a 28-year-old male of Mediterranean descent with recurrent fever episodes since childhood. The episodes last 1-3 days and come every 2-3 weeks. During these episodes, he has severe abdominal pain, chest pain with breathing difficulties, and joint pain in knees and ankles. His family history includes the father and paternal uncle with similar symptoms. Labs during attacks show elevated CRP, ESR, and WBC. Between episodes, he's asymptomatic.\n\nHmm, recurrent fevers with family history points towards a hereditary condition. Mediterranean descent makes me think of Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF). FMF is an autoinflammatory disorder, common in that ethnic group. The symptoms like periodic fever, abdominal pain (serositis), chest pain (pleuritis), and joint pain fit. Also, the family history supports it. The lab findings during attacks (elevated inflammatory markers) align with FMF flares. Since genetic testing is pending, maybe MEFV gene mutations would confirm it. So FMF is the primary diagnosis here with high confidence. ICD-10 code is E85.0.\n\nDifferential diagnoses? Let's think. Another periodic fever syndrome like TNF receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS). It also has recurrent fevers, abdominal pain, and family history. But TRAPS episodes typically last longer than a week, which isn't the case here. Still, possible. ICD-10 E85.1.\n\nAnother possibility is Beh\u00e7et's disease. It can cause oral ulcers, genital ulcers, uveitis, but the recurrent fever and family history aren't as typical. But joint pain and possible vasculitis. However, absent other symptoms, maybe lower confidence. ICD-10 M35.2.\n\nSystemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (sJIA) can present with recurrent fevers, joint pain, and elevated markers. But sJIA usually has daily spiking fevers and rash (salmon-colored), which isn't mentioned here. Still a differential. ICD-10 M08.2.\n\nHereditary angioedema (HAE) could cause abdominal pain and swelling, but usually without fever. Doesn't fit as well. Maybe not in the top differentials.\n\nAnother one: Hyperimmunoglobulin D syndrome (HIDS). It causes recurrent fevers, abdominal pain, joint pain, and elevated IgD. But more common in Northern Europeans. Still, possible. ICD-10 E85.8.\n\nWait, the patient is of Mediterranean descent, so FMF is more likely than HIDS. But since he's pending genetic testing, we need to list differentials. So top differentials: TRAPS, HIDS, Beh\u00e7et's, sJIA. But Beh\u00e7et's maybe less likely without mucocutaneous symptoms. Maybe include HIDS and TRAPS as main differentials.\n\nKey findings would be the recurrent episodic symptoms, family history, Mediterranean background, elevated inflammatory markers during attacks, and asymptomatic between episodes.\n\nTests needed: Confirm FMF with genetic testing for MEFV mutations (priority: urgent). Also, serum amyloid A (SAA) to check for amyloidosis risk. During attacks, maybe check IgD levels for HIDS. Also, urinalysis to check for proteinuria (possible amyloidosis). Imaging like abdominal ultrasound during attacks to assess for serositis. Echocardiogram for pericardial involvement. But since genetic test is pending, that's key.\n\nManagement: Immediate during attacks would be NSAIDs for pain and inflammation. Colchicine is the mainstay for prophylaxis, which reduces attacks and amyloidosis risk. Dose would be colchicine 0.6 mg twice daily. If colchicine isn't effective, maybe biologics like anakinra. Consult rheumatology for management. Monitor for complications like amyloidosis.\n\nRed flags: Signs of amyloidosis (proteinuria, renal dysfunction), severe chest pain suggesting pericarditis, or unremitting fever. Also, if episodes become more frequent or severe.\n\nWait, in the output, the tests need to be prioritized. Immediate, urgent, routine. Genetic test is urgent. SAA and IgD maybe urgent. Urinalysis could be routine if not during attack. CRP and ESR are already done. Maybe genetic testing, SAA, IgD as urgent.\n\nMeds: Colchicine 0.6 mg PO BID would be standard.\n\nSo putting it all together. Primary diagnosis is FMF with high confidence. Differentials as TRAPS, HIDS, Beh\u00e7et's, sJIA. Tests include MEFV testing, SAA, IgD, etc. Management with colchicine. Consult rheumatology urgently.\n\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\n    \"primary_diagnosis\": {\n        \"name\": \"Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF)\",\n        \"confidence\": 0.95,\n        \"icd_code\": \"E85.0\"\n    },\n    \"differential_diagnoses\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"TNF Receptor-Associated Periodic Syndrome (TRAPS)\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.7,\n            \"icd_code\": \"E85.1\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Hyperimmunoglobulin D Syndrome (HIDS)\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.6,\n            \"icd_code\": \"E85.8\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (sJIA)\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.4,\n            \"icd_code\": \"M08.2\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Beh\u00e7et\u2019s Disease\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.3,\n            \"icd_code\": \"M35.2\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"key_findings\": [\n        \"Recurrent self-limiting fever episodes since childhood\",\n        \"Mediterranean descent with positive family history\",\n        \"Serositis (abdominal/chest pain) and arthritis\",\n        \"Elevated CRP, ESR, and WBC during attacks\",\n        \"Asymptomatic between episodes\"\n    ],\n    \"tests\": [\n        {\n            \"test\": \"MEFV gene mutation analysis\",\n            \"priority\": \"urgent\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Serum amyloid A (SAA)\",\n            \"priority\": \"urgent\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Immunoglobulin D (IgD) level\",\n            \"priority\": \"urgent\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Urinalysis for proteinuria\",\n            \"priority\": \"routine\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"management\": {\n        \"immediate\": [\n            \"NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen) for symptomatic relief during attacks\"\n        ],\n        \"medications\": [\n            \"colchicine: 0.6 mg PO twice daily (prophylaxis)\",\n            \"anakinra: 1-2 mg/kg SC daily (if colchicine-resistant)\"\n        ],\n        \"consultations\": [\n            \"rheumatology: urgent\",\n            \"genetics: routine\"\n        ]\n    },\n    \"red_flags\": [\n        \"Persistent proteinuria (amyloidosis)\",\n        \"Prolonged fever >7 days\",\n        \"Neurologic symptoms or vision changes\",\n        \"Pericardial effusion or tamponade\"\n    ]\n}\n```",
