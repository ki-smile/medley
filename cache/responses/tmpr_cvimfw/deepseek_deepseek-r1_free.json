  "content": "Okay, let me try to work through this case. The patient is a 28-year-old male of Mediterranean descent with recurrent fever episodes lasting 1-3 days, along with severe abdominal pain, chest pain with breathing difficulties, and joint pain in knees and ankles. His family history includes similar symptoms in his father and paternal uncle. The episodes started around age 7, happening every 2-3 weeks. Labs during attacks show elevated CRP, ESR, and WBC, but he's asymptomatic between episodes. Genetic testing is pending.\n\nFirst, considering the recurrent fever, family history, and Mediterranean descent, Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) comes to mind. FMF is an autosomal recessive disorder common in people from the Mediterranean region. The key symptoms of periodic fever, abdominal pain (serositis), chest pain (pleuritis), and joint involvement fit. The elevated inflammatory markers during attacks and family history support this. The ICD-10 code for FMF is E85.0. Confidence might be high, like 0.9, but pending genetic testing.\n\nDifferential diagnoses could include:\n1. Periodic Fever Syndrome (maybe another one like TRAPS, TNF Receptor-Associated Periodic Syndrome). TRAPS is autosomal dominant, but the family history here includes father and uncle, which could be autosomal dominant. But FMF is more common. The ICD-10 for TRAPS might be E85.1.\n2. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) \u2013 but SLE usually has more systemic symptoms and positive autoantibodies. However, with joint pain and serositis, it's a possibility. But the episodic nature makes it less likely. ICD-10 M32.9.\n3. Gout \u2013 presents with joint pain, but typically in older adults, and associated with hyperuricemia. However, the patient is young, and other symptoms like fever and abdominal pain aren't typical. ICD-10 M10.9.\n4. Beh\u00e7et\u2019s Disease \u2013 can cause oral ulcers, uveitis, and joint pain, but recurrent fever isn't a primary feature. Maybe less likely here. ICD-10 M35.2.\n\nKey findings would be the recurrent self-limiting fevers, family history, Mediterranean ethnicity, serositis symptoms (abdominal, chest pain), joint involvement, and lab markers during attacks.\n\nTests needed: Genetic testing for MEFV gene mutations (for FMF), which is pending. Maybe also check serum immunoglobulins, ANA for lupus, uric acid for gout. Consider imaging like abdominal ultrasound during an attack. Since genetic testing is already pending, priority would be immediate for confirming FMF. Other tests might be routine or urgent.\n\nManagement: Colchicine is the mainstay for FMF to prevent attacks. Dose typically 1.2-1.8 mg/day orally. NSAIDs for symptom relief during attacks. Immediate actions could include starting colchicine once diagnosed. Consultations with a rheumatologist urgently. Also, genetic counseling given the hereditary nature.\n\nRed flags would be signs of complications like amyloidosis (proteinuria), severe serositis leading to peritonitis or pericarditis, or if symptoms don't respond to treatment.\n\nI need to check ICD codes. FMF is E85.0, TRAPS is E85.1. SLE M32.9, Gout M10.9, Beh\u00e7et\u2019s M35.2. Test priorities: Genetic test is immediate. CRP, ESR, WBC already done. Maybe checking serum amyloid A (urgent). For differentials, ANA, uric acid, maybe imaging. Medications: Colchicine 1.2 mg PO daily (standard dose). NSAIDs like ibuprofen for pain. \n\nSo putting this all together in JSON as specified.\n\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\n    \"primary_diagnosis\": {\n        \"name\": \"Familial Mediterranean Fever\",\n        \"confidence\": 0.9,\n        \"icd_code\": \"E85.0\"\n    },\n    \"differential_diagnoses\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"TNF Receptor-Associated Periodic Syndrome (TRAPS)\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.6,\n            \"icd_code\": \"E85.1\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Systemic Lupus Erythematosus\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.4,\n            \"icd_code\": \"M32.9\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Gout\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.2,\n            \"icd_code\": \"M10.9\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Beh\u00e7et\u2019s Disease\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.2,\n            \"icd_code\": \"M35.2\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"key_findings\": [\n        \"Recurrent self-limiting fever episodes\",\n        \"Family history of similar symptoms\",\n        \"Mediterranean descent\",\n        \"Serositis (abdominal/chest pain)\",\n        \"Elevated CRP/ESR/WBC during attacks\",\n        \"Asymptomatic between episodes\"\n    ],\n    \"tests\": [\n        {\n            \"test\": \"MEFV gene sequencing (confirm FMF)\",\n            \"priority\": \"immediate\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Serum amyloid A (SAA)\",\n            \"priority\": \"urgent\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"ANA and anti-dsDNA (rule out SLE)\",\n            \"priority\": \"urgent\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Uric acid level (rule out gout)\",\n            \"priority\": \"routine\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"management\": {\n        \"immediate\": [\"Start empiric colchicine pending genetic results\"],\n        \"medications\": [\n            \"colchicine: 1.2 mg PO daily (titrate to 1.8 mg if tolerated)\",\n            \"ibuprofen: 400-600 mg PO every 6 hours PRN pain\"\n        ],\n        \"consultations\": [\n            \"rheumatology: urgent\",\n            \"genetic counseling: routine\"\n        ]\n    },\n    \"red_flags\": [\n        \"Persistent fever >5 days\",\n        \"Signs of amyloidosis (e.g., proteinuria)\",\n        \"Respiratory failure (severe pleuritis)\",\n        \"Non-response to colchicine\"\n    ]\n}\n```",
