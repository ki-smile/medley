However, other possibilities should be ruled out, as listed in the differential diagnoses section. Immediate genetic testing for MEFV gene mutations is recommended. If symptoms persist or worsen, consult a rheumatologist. Colchicine is suggested as an immediate treatment for symptom relief, and further management may involve additional medications based on the final diagnosis. Red flags include persistent high fever, neurological symptoms, significant weight loss, and persistent chest pain, which warrant further investigation.",
