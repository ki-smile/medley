  "content": "Let me analyze this medical case step by step. A 50-year-old patient presents with severe chest pain. I need to provide a comprehensive analysis in JSON format based on the provided search results.\n\nKey information from the search results:\n\n1. Chest pain is a common emergency presentation that requires immediate evaluation for life-threatening conditions\n2. The primary concern is acute coronary syndrome (ACS), which includes STEMI and NSTE-ACS\n3. Other life-threatening causes include pulmonary embolism, aortic dissection, tension pneumothorax, and esophageal rupture\n4. Initial assessment should follow ABC approach with immediate ECG and troponin\n5. Risk stratification tools like HEART score are valuable\n6. Treatment varies based on diagnosis but may include nitroglycerin, aspirin, anticoagulation\n\nFor a 50-year-old with severe chest pain:\n\nPrimary diagnosis: I should consider ACS as the primary concern given the age and severity. The confidence should be moderate since we don't have full clinical details.\n\nDifferential diagnoses should include:\n- Acute coronary syndrome\n- Pulmonary embolism  \n- Aortic dissection\n- Pericarditis\n- Musculoskeletal chest pain\n\nTests needed:\n- ECG (immediate)\n- Troponin (immediate)\n- Chest X-ray (urgent)\n- CBC, BNP, D-dimer (urgent)\n\nManagement:\n- ABC assessment\n- IV access, O2 if hypoxic, monitor\n- Aspirin 325mg chewed if no contraindications\n- Nitroglycerin if BP >100 mmHg\n- Pain control\n\nRed flags from the sources:\n- Sudden onset\n- Severe pain\n- Age >45\n- Exertional component would be concerning\n\nLet me structure this properly in JSON format:\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\n    \"primary_diagnosis\": {\n        \"name\": \"Acute Coronary Syndrome\",\n        \"confidence\": 0.7,\n        \"icd_code\": \"I20.9\"\n    },\n    \"differential_diagnoses\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.6,\n            \"icd_code\": \"I21.9\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Pulmonary Embolism\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.4,\n            \"icd_code\": \"I26.9\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Aortic Dissection\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.3,\n            \"icd_code\": \"I71.00\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Pericarditis\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.3,\n            \"icd_code\": \"I30.9\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Chest Pain, Unspecified\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.2,\n            \"icd_code\": \"R07.9\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"key_findings\": [\n        \"50-year-old patient with severe chest pain\",\n        \"Age >45 increases cardiac risk\",\n        \"Severity of pain warrants immediate evaluation\",\n        \"High-risk presentation requiring exclusion of life-threatening causes\"\n    ],\n    \"tests\": [\n        {\n            \"test\": \"12-lead ECG\",\n            \"priority\": \"immediate\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Troponin I or T\",\n            \"priority\": \"immediate\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Chest X-ray\",\n            \"priority\": \"urgent\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Complete blood count\",\n            \"priority\": \"urgent\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Basic metabolic panel\",\n            \"priority\": \"urgent\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"D-dimer\",\n            \"priority\": \"urgent\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"PT/PTT\",\n            \"priority\": \"routine\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"management\": {\n        \"immediate\": [\n            \"ABCDE primary survey\",\n            \"IV access and continuous cardiac monitoring\",\n            \"Oxygen if hypoxic (SpO2 <90%)\",\n            \"Vital signs assessment\",\n            \"Place defibrillation pads if unstable\"\n        ],\n        \"medications\": [\n            \"Aspirin: 162-325mg, chewed, once\",\n            \"Nitroglycerin: 0.3-0.4mg sublingual if SBP >100mmHg, repeat q5min x3\",\n            \"Morphine: 2-5mg IV if severe pain and SBP >100mmHg\",\n            \"Heparin: per protocol if ACS confirmed\"\n        ],\n        \"consultations\": [\n            \"Cardiology: urgent\",\n            \"Emergency Medicine: immediate\"\n        ]\n    },\n    \"red_flags\": [\n        \"Severe chest pain intensity\",\n        \"Male gender and age >45\",\n        \"Potential for rapid clinical deterioration\",\n        \"Risk of sudden cardiac arrest\",\n        \"Need to exclude STEMI requiring emergent PCI\"\n    ]\n}\n```",
