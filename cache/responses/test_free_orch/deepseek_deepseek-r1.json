  "content": "Okay, let's tackle this case. So, a 50-year-old patient comes in with severe chest pain. First, I need to think about the possible causes of chest pain in this age group. The primary concern is always ruling out life-threatening conditions. The top differential would be acute coronary syndrome, like a myocardial infarction. That's the most urgent to address.\n\nThe primary diagnosis is probably Acute Myocardial Infarction. The ICD-10 code for that is I21.9. Confidence level isn't 100% without more tests, so maybe 0.8? Next, other differentials. Aortic dissection is another critical one; code I71.00. Confidence lower, maybe 0.3. Pulmonary embolism (I26.99) is possible, so confidence 0.25. Then gastroesophageal reflux disease (K21.9) at 0.2, and maybe unstable angina (I20.0) at 0.2. Wait, but unstable angina is part of ACS too. Hmm, maybe adjust the confidence levels.\n\nKey findings: severe chest pain. But the user only gave that one symptom. So I can list that as the key finding. Need to think about red flags like radiating pain, hypotension, etc. But since the case is sparse, maybe list the absence of more info as a red flag?\n\nTests: ECG immediately, troponin levels urgent, chest X-ray immediate to check for dissection or other issues. Maybe a CTA for pulmonary embolism or aortic dissection if suspected. D-dimer could be considered but maybe lower priority. Echocardiogram to check wall motion abnormalities.\n\nManagement: Immediate actions like aspirin 324 mg chewable, nitroglycerin sublingual if BP is okay, oxygen if needed. Morphine for pain if necessary. Medications list those. Consultations: cardiology immediately, maybe vascular surgery for possible dissection. Red flags would be signs of shock, worsening pain, etc.\n\nNeed to check medication doses. Aspirin is typically 324 mg for ACS. Nitroglycerin 0.4 mg sublingual every 5 minutes. Morphine 2-4 mg IV. Also, make sure ICD codes are correct. Aortic dissection is I71.00, PE I26.99, GERD K21.9, Unstable angina I20.0. \n\nWait, differentials should be 3-5. I have five here. Maybe that's okay. But check if any could be combined. Unstable angina and MI are both ACS, but maybe they are separate differentials. Okay.\n\nSo putting it all together, the JSON structure with the required fields. Make sure tests are ordered by priority. Immediate: ECG, CXR. Urgent: Troponin, CTA. Maybe D-dimer is routine? Or urgent. Let me check. Troponin is urgent. CTA would be urgent if high suspicion. So tests: ECG (immediate), Troponin (urgent), CXR (immediate), CTA (urgent), Echocardiogram (urgent). Maybe D-dimer is routine if PE is lower on the list.\n\nRed flags: Hypotension, syncope, radiating pain, etc. So list those as possible red flags even if not mentioned in the case.\n\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\n    \"primary_diagnosis\": {\n        \"name\": \"Acute Myocardial Infarction\",\n        \"confidence\": 0.8,\n        \"icd_code\": \"I21.9\"\n    },\n    \"differential_diagnoses\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Aortic Dissection\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.3,\n            \"icd_code\": \"I71.00\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Pulmonary Embolism\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.25,\n            \"icd_code\": \"I26.99\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.2,\n            \"icd_code\": \"K21.9\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Unstable Angina\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.2,\n            \"icd_code\": \"I20.0\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"key_findings\": [\"Severe chest pain\"],\n    \"tests\": [\n        {\n            \"test\": \"12-lead ECG\",\n            \"priority\": \"immediate\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Troponin level\",\n            \"priority\": \"urgent\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Chest X-ray\",\n            \"priority\": \"immediate\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"CT Angiography (chest)\",\n            \"priority\": \"urgent\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"D-dimer\",\n            \"priority\": \"routine\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"management\": {\n        \"immediate\": [\n            \"Aspirin 324 mg chewable\",\n            \"Nitroglycerin 0.4 mg sublingual every 5 minutes (if BP \u2265100 mmHg)\",\n            \"Oxygen therapy if SpO\u2082 <90%\",\n            \"IV access and cardiac monitoring\"\n        ],\n        \"medications\": [\n            \"Morphine: 2-4 mg IV every 5-15 minutes (for pain unresponsive to nitroglycerin)\",\n            \"Heparin: 60 U/kg IV bolus (max 4000 U), then 12 U/kg/hr infusion (if STEMI confirmed)\"\n        ],\n        \"consultations\": [\n            \"Cardiology: immediate\",\n            \"Vascular Surgery: urgent (if aortic dissection suspected)\"\n        ]\n    },\n    \"red_flags\": [\n        \"Hypotension (BP <90/60 mmHg)\",\n        \"Syncope or altered mental status\",\n        \"Pain radiating to jaw/back\",\n        \"Respiratory distress\",\n        \"ST-segment elevation on ECG\"\n    ]\n}\n```",
