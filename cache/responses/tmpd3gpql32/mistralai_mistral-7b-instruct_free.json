However, other conditions such as Reactive Arthritis, Ankylosing Spondylitis, Inflammatory Bowel Disease, Hyperimmunoglobulin D with periodic fever syndrome, and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus are also potential differential diagnoses.\n\nThe key findings are recurrent fever, abdominal pain, joint pain, and family history of similar symptoms. Immediate tests include a Complete Blood Count (CBC), while urgent tests involve repeating CRP, ESR, and WBC during remission. Routine tests include HLA-B27 testing and genetic testing.\n\nThe management includes immediate administration of antipyretics, colchicine, and NSAIDs for pain relief. The patient is also urged to consult a rheumatologist urgently. Red flags include persistent symptoms despite treatment and the appearance of new symptoms such as visual changes or neurological issues.",
