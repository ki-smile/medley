The differential diagnoses include Reactive Arthritis, Ankylosing Spondylitis, Inflammatory Bowel Disease, Pseudogout, and Rheumatoid Arthritis, as they share some similarities with the presented symptoms. The patient should undergo genetic testing and HLA-B27 testing for further confirmation. The immediate management includes starting colchicine and consulting a rheumatologist. Red flags include persistent high fever and evidence of internal organ damage during episodes.",
