  "content": "Okay, let's tackle this medical case. The patient is a 45-year-old male with sudden onset chest pain, crushing and substernal, radiating to the left arm. He's sweating, nauseous. Past history includes hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, smoking, and family history of CAD. His ECG shows ST elevation in II, III, aVF, which points to an inferior STEMI. Elevated troponin and CK-MB confirm myocardial injury.\n\nPrimary diagnosis is STEMI, ICD-10 I21.09. High confidence due to classic symptoms, risk factors, and ECG findings. Differential diagnoses: unstable angina (but troponin is up, so lower confidence), aortic dissection (no tearing pain, BP not too different, but still possible), PE (but O2 sats are okay, ECG different), pericarditis (ST elevation in multiple leads without reciprocal changes? Not sure, but the leads here are inferior, might consider). \n\nKey findings: chest pain characteristics, ST elevation in inferior leads, elevated cardiac enzymes. Tests: immediate ECG, troponin, CK-MB. Maybe urgent echo, CXR, ABG. Management: Aspirin, nitroglycerin, morphine if needed, beta-blocker like metoprolol, statin, heparin. Consult cardiology and cath lab immediately. Red flags include worsening symptoms and arrhythmias.\n\nNeed to check if ST elevation in II, III, aVF is indeed STEMI, so primary is STEMI. Differentials need ICD codes. Make sure meds have correct doses, like aspirin 324 mg chewed. Heparin bolus and infusion. Consultations should be cardiology immediate. Red flags like sudden hypotension or arrhythmias.\n\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\n    \"primary_diagnosis\": {\n        \"name\": \"ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)\",\n        \"confidence\": 0.95,\n        \"icd_code\": \"I21.09\"\n    },\n    \"differential_diagnoses\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Unstable angina\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.3,\n            \"icd_code\": \"I20.0\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Aortic dissection\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.25,\n            \"icd_code\": \"I71.00\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Pulmonary embolism\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.2,\n            \"icd_code\": \"I26.99\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Acute pericarditis\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.15,\n            \"icd_code\": \"I30.9\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"key_findings\": [\n        \"Crushing substernal chest pain with radiation to left arm\",\n        \"ST elevation in leads II, III, aVF on ECG\",\n        \"Elevated Troponin I and CK-MB\",\n        \"Diaphoresis, nausea, and hypertension\",\n        \"History of hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and smoking\"\n    ],\n    \"tests\": [\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Repeat ECG\",\n            \"priority\": \"immediate\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Serial cardiac biomarkers (Troponin, CK-MB)\",\n            \"priority\": \"immediate\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Echocardiogram\",\n            \"priority\": \"urgent\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Chest X-ray\",\n            \"priority\": \"urgent\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Arterial blood gas (ABG)\",\n            \"priority\": \"urgent\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"management\": {\n        \"immediate\": [\n            \"Oxygen therapy to maintain SpO2 \u226590%\",\n            \"Aspirin 324 mg chewed\",\n            \"Nitroglycerin sublingual 0.4 mg every 5 minutes (if BP permits)\"\n        ],\n        \"medications\": [\n            \"Morphine sulfate: 2-4 mg IV every 5-15 minutes (for pain unresponsive to nitroglycerin)\",\n            \"Metoprolol: 5 mg IV every 5 minutes (up to 3 doses) if hemodynamically stable\",\n            \"Atorvastatin: 80 mg PO once daily\",\n            \"Heparin: 60 IU/kg IV bolus (max 4000 IU), then 12 IU/kg/hr infusion (max 1000 IU/hr)\"\n        ],\n        \"consultations\": [\n            \"Cardiology: immediate\",\n            \"Cardiac catheterization lab: immediate\"\n        ]\n    },\n    \"red_flags\": [\n        \"Sudden hypotension or arrhythmias\",\n        \"Persistent chest pain despite treatment\",\n        \"Signs of cardiogenic shock (e.g., altered mental status, cold extremities)\",\n        \"Worsening ST elevation or new arrhythmias on ECG\"\n    ]\n}\n```",
