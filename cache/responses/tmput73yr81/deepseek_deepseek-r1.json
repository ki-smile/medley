  "content": "Okay, let's tackle this medical case. The patient is a 28-year-old male of Mediterranean descent with recurrent fever episodes, abdominal pain, chest pain, joint pain, and a family history of similar symptoms. The episodes last 1-3 days, occur every 2-3 weeks since childhood, and labs show elevated CRP, ESR, WBC during attacks. He's asymptomatic between episodes.\n\nFirst, the Mediterranean background makes me think of Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF). The recurrent fevers, family history, and serositis symptoms (abdominal, chest pain) fit FMF. The age of onset around 7 is typical. ICD-10 is E85.0. Confidence is high, maybe 0.9 since genetic testing is pending but clinical signs strongly suggest it.\n\nDifferential diagnoses: \n1. Periodic Fever Syndrome (like HIDS). HIDS has longer fever episodes and might not align with the 1-3 days here, but still possible. ICD-10 E85.8. Confidence lower, maybe 0.3.\n2. Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (SJIA). Can cause recurrent fever, joint pain, elevated markers. But usually daily fevers and rash. ICD-10 M08.2. Confidence 0.2.\n3. Beh\u00e7et\u2019s Disease. Oral/genital ulcers, but not mentioned here. Still, possible with joint and chest pain. ICD-10 M35.2. Confidence 0.15.\n4. Rheumatic Fever. Migratory arthritis, but needs evidence of streptococcal infection. Less likely here. ICD-10 I00. Confidence 0.1.\n\nKey findings: Recurrent short fevers, family history, serositis symptoms, elevated inflammatory markers during attacks, asymptomatic between episodes.\n\nTests: Genetic testing for MEFV mutations (immediate), serum IgD (urgent for HIDS), HLA-B51 (routine for Beh\u00e7et\u2019s), throat culture and ASO titer (routine for rheumatic fever).\n\nManagement: Immediate symptom relief with NSAIDs. Colchicine is standard for FMF prophylaxis, so start that. Consult rheumatology urgently and genetics.\n\nRed flags: Severe chest pain with breathing issues could indicate pleuritis or pericarditis. Need to monitor for complications like amyloidosis.\n\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\n    \"primary_diagnosis\": {\n        \"name\": \"Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF)\",\n        \"confidence\": 0.9,\n        \"icd_code\": \"E85.0\"\n    },\n    \"differential_diagnoses\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Hyperimmunoglobulinemia D Syndrome (HIDS)\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.3,\n            \"icd_code\": \"E85.8\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (SJIA)\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.2,\n            \"icd_code\": \"M08.2\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Beh\u00e7et\u2019s Disease\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.15,\n            \"icd_code\": \"M35.2\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Acute Rheumatic Fever\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.1,\n            \"icd_code\": \"I00\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"key_findings\": [\n        \"Recurrent self-limiting fever episodes (1-3 days)\",\n        \"Family history of similar symptoms (autosomal recessive pattern)\",\n        \"Serositis (abdominal pain, pleuritic chest pain)\",\n        \"Elevated CRP/ESR/WBC during attacks\",\n        \"Asymptomatic between episodes\"\n    ],\n    \"tests\": [\n        {\n            \"test\": \"MEFV gene sequencing\",\n            \"priority\": \"immediate\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Serum IgD levels\",\n            \"priority\": \"urgent\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"HLA-B51 testing\",\n            \"priority\": \"routine\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Throat culture/ASO titer\",\n            \"priority\": \"routine\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"management\": {\n        \"immediate\": [\"Symptomatic relief with NSAIDs during attacks\"],\n        \"medications\": [\n            \"colchicine: 1.2 mg PO daily (prophylaxis)\",\n            \"canakinumab: 150 mg SC every 4-8 weeks (if refractory)\"\n        ],\n        \"consultations\": [\n            \"Rheumatology: urgent\",\n            \"Clinical Genetics: urgent\"\n        ]\n    },\n    \"red_flags\": [\n        \"Persistent chest pain suggesting pericarditis\",\n        \"Renal dysfunction (possible amyloidosis)\",\n        \"Neurological symptoms\",\n        \"Prolonged fever >7 days\"\n    ]\n}\n```",
