  "content": "Okay, let's tackle this medical case. First, the patient is a 58-year-old man with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes. These are all major risk factors for cardiovascular disease. He presents with exertional chest pain that radiates to the left shoulder and jaw, which is classic for angina. The fact that it's triggered by activity and relieved by rest points towards stable angina, but today he had a more intense episode that didn't fully resolve with rest. That makes me think unstable angina or even an acute coronary syndrome (ACS). \n\nHe denies dyspnea at rest, nausea, or sweating, which are typical of MI, but the prolonged episode is concerning. His risk factors include smoking, sedentary lifestyle, poor diet, and family history\u2014father had an MI at 60. His medications include aspirin started two weeks ago, which might have been for primary prevention.\n\nPrimary diagnosis would likely be unstable angina (I20.0). Differential diagnoses could include NSTEMI (since symptoms are prolonged but without some typical symptoms like nausea), stable angina (though the recent change makes it less likely), GERD, and maybe a musculoskeletal cause. Testing needs to be immediate: EKG, troponin levels, CXR. Also check electrolytes and a lipid panel. Management should include nitroglycerin, continuing aspirin, maybe adding clopidogrel as per ACS protocol. Beta-blocker like metoprolol could help. Consult cardiology immediately. Red flags are the radiation of pain, prolonged episode, and high-risk history.\n\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\n    \"primary_diagnosis\": {\n        \"name\": \"Unstable Angina\",\n        \"confidence\": 0.9,\n        \"icd_code\": \"I20.0\"\n    },\n    \"differential_diagnoses\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI)\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.7,\n            \"icd_code\": \"I21.4\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Stable Angina\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.4,\n            \"icd_code\": \"I20.9\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.2,\n            \"icd_code\": \"K21.9\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Musculoskeletal Chest Pain\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.1,\n            \"icd_code\": \"M79.1\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"key_findings\": [\n        \"Intermittent exertional chest pain with radiation to left shoulder/jaw\",\n        \"Prolonged episode (20 minutes) not fully relieved by rest\",\n        \"History of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, smoking, and family CAD\",\n        \"Sedentary lifestyle and high-risk diet\"\n    ],\n    \"tests\": [\n        {\n            \"test\": \"12-lead ECG\",\n            \"priority\": \"immediate\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Cardiac troponin (serial)\",\n            \"priority\": \"immediate\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Chest X-ray\",\n            \"priority\": \"urgent\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Lipid panel\",\n            \"priority\": \"urgent\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"HbA1c\",\n            \"priority\": \"routine\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"management\": {\n        \"immediate\": [\n            \"Continuous cardiac monitoring\",\n            \"Supplemental oxygen if SpO2 <94%\",\n            \"Sublingual nitroglycerin for ongoing pain\"\n        ],\n        \"medications\": [\n            \"aspirin: 162-325 mg, oral (chewed)\",\n            \"clopidogrel: 300-600 mg loading dose, oral\",\n            \"nitroglycerin: 0.4 mg sublingual every 5 minutes (max 3 doses)\",\n            \"metoprolol: 25-50 mg, oral (if no contraindications)\"\n        ],\n        \"consultations\": [\n            \"cardiology: immediate\",\n            \"dietitian: urgent\"\n        ]\n    },\n    \"red_flags\": [\n        \"Chest pain radiating to jaw/shoulder\",\n        \"Prolonged unrelieved episode\",\n        \"High cardiovascular risk profile\",\n        \"Family history of premature CAD\"\n    ]\n}\n```",
