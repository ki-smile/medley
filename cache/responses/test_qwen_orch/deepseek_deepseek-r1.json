  "content": "Okay, let's tackle this medical case. The patient is a 45-year-old presenting with chest pain. First, I need to consider the most common and serious causes of chest pain. The primary diagnosis is likely acute coronary syndrome (ACS), which includes unstable angina and myocardial infarction. Chest pain in a middle-aged person raises suspicion for cardiac issues. The confidence here should be moderate, maybe around 0.6, since there's not enough information about the pain's characteristics, risk factors, or other symptoms. The ICD-10 code for ACS would be I20.0 for unstable angina, but if it's a heart attack, it could be I21.9. But since the case is vague, sticking with I20.0 might be safer.\n\nNext, differential diagnoses. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a common non-cardiac cause. Confidence around 0.3. ICD-10 K21.9. Then, musculoskeletal chest pain, like costochondritis. Confidence 0.25. ICD-10 M54.6. Pulmonary embolism is another serious possibility, especially if there's sudden onset, dyspnea, or risk factors like immobility. Confidence 0.2. ICD-10 I26.99. Maybe aortic dissection if there's tearing pain radiating to the back, but without more info, confidence lower, say 0.15. ICD-10 I71.01.\n\nKey findings would be chest pain without more specifics, but since the user didn't provide details, maybe list \"Chest pain, location and characteristics unspecified\" as a key finding. Wait, but maybe better to note that the presentation is vague, so key findings are limited. Hmm.\n\nTests: Immediate ECG to check for ST changes. Troponin levels urgent. CXR for pulmonary issues. D-dimer if PE suspected, but that's maybe urgent. Echocardiogram could be routine. Also, maybe a stress test as routine. Wait, priority levels: ECG and troponin should be immediate. CXR urgent. D-dimer urgent. Then others routine.\n\nManagement: Immediate actions like aspirin 325 mg chewable, nitroglycerin sublingual, oxygen if hypoxic. Medications: Aspirin 325 mg once, Nitroglycerin 0.4 mg SL every 5 minutes up to three doses. Consult cardiology immediately. For GERD, maybe PPIs, but that's part of differential management. Red flags would include pain radiating to jaw/arm, dyspnea, hypotension, syncope, which indicate more serious conditions.\n\nWait, the management section should include immediate actions, medications, and consultations. So immediate actions: aspirin, nitro, oxygen. Medications: list those doses. Consult cardiology with immediate urgency. Red flags: those symptoms mentioned earlier.\n\nNeed to make sure ICD-10 codes are correct. Check GERD is K21.9, costochondritis M54.6, PE I26.99, aortic dissection I71.01. Yes.\n\nConfidence scores: Primary ACS 0.6. Differentials GERD 0.3, musculoskeletal 0.25, PE 0.2, aortic dissection 0.15. Tests ordered by priority: ECG immediate, troponin immediate? Or urgent? Maybe ECG immediate, troponin urgent. Wait, troponin is usually urgent but in an emergency setting, it's done stat. Maybe prioritize as immediate. CXR urgent. D-dimer urgent. Echo routine.\n\nMedications: Aspirin 325 mg chewable once. Nitroglycerin 0.4 mg SL every 5 minutes. Maybe morphine if pain is severe, but not sure if needed here. Consult cardiology immediately.\n\nRed flags: radiating pain, dyspnea, hypotension, diaphoresis, syncope.\n\nOkay, putting it all together in JSON format as specified. Make sure no markdown, just plain JSON. Check for valid structure, arrays, commas, etc.\n\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\n    \"primary_diagnosis\": {\n        \"name\": \"Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS)\",\n        \"confidence\": 0.6,\n        \"icd_code\": \"I20.0\"\n    },\n    \"differential_diagnoses\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.3,\n            \"icd_code\": \"K21.9\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Musculoskeletal Chest Pain (e.g., Costochondritis)\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.25,\n            \"icd_code\": \"M54.6\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Pulmonary Embolism\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.2,\n            \"icd_code\": \"I26.99\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Aortic Dissection\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.15,\n            \"icd_code\": \"I71.01\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"key_findings\": [\"Chest pain (location/characteristics unspecified)\"],\n    \"tests\": [\n        {\n            \"test\": \"12-lead ECG\",\n            \"priority\": \"immediate\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Cardiac Troponin\",\n            \"priority\": \"immediate\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Chest X-ray\",\n            \"priority\": \"urgent\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"D-dimer\",\n            \"priority\": \"urgent\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Echocardiogram\",\n            \"priority\": \"routine\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"management\": {\n        \"immediate\": [\n            \"Aspirin 325 mg chewable (if ACS suspected)\",\n            \"Nitroglycerin sublingual (if no hypotension)\",\n            \"Oxygen if SpO2 < 90%\"\n        ],\n        \"medications\": [\n            \"Aspirin: 325 mg chewable, oral (once)\",\n            \"Nitroglycerin: 0.4 mg, sublingual every 5 minutes (max 3 doses)\"\n        ],\n        \"consultations\": [\n            \"Cardiology: immediate\"\n        ]\n    },\n    \"red_flags\": [\n        \"Pain radiating to jaw/left arm\",\n        \"Sudden dyspnea\",\n        \"Hypotension (SBP < 90 mmHg)\",\n        \"Diaphoresis\",\n        \"Syncope\"\n    ]\n}\n```",
