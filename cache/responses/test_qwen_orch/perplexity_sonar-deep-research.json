  "content": "The query is asking for a medical case analysis in JSON format for a 45-year-old presenting with chest pain. This is a very broad presentation and I need to consider the various causes of chest pain and provide appropriate differential diagnoses with confidence levels.\n\nBased on the provided search results, I can see that chest pain has many causes, but the most important ones to consider first are the life-threatening causes:\n\n1. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) - including myocardial infarction and unstable angina\n2. Aortic dissection\n3. Pulmonary embolism\n4. Tension pneumothorax\n5. Pericarditis\n6. Esophageal rupture\n\nGiven that this is a 45-year-old patient (middle-aged) with chest pain and no other specific details provided, I need to consider:\n\n- ACS would be a primary concern given the age and presentation\n- Other cardiac causes like pericarditis\n- Pulmonary causes like PE\n- GI causes like GERD\n- Musculoskeletal causes\n\nFor the primary diagnosis, given the limited information and the age group, I should consider ACS as the primary working diagnosis that needs to be ruled out first, but with moderate confidence since we don't have details about the pain characteristics, risk factors, etc.\n\nFor differential diagnoses, I should include:\n1. ACS/MI (primary)\n2. Unstable angina\n3. Pericarditis\n4. Pulmonary embolism\n5. GERD/esophageal spasm\n\nKey findings would be limited since we only have age and chief complaint.\n\nTests should prioritize ruling out life-threatening causes:\n- ECG (immediate)\n- Troponin (immediate)\n- Chest X-ray (urgent)\n- CBC, BMP (routine)\n- D-dimer if PE suspected\n\nManagement should focus on immediate stabilization and ruling out emergent causes.\n\nRed flags would include typical cardiac symptoms that suggest ACS.\n\n\nI'll create a structured JSON representation to capture the critical medical information systematically, ensuring all key diagnostic and clinical details are comprehensively documented.\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\n    \"primary_diagnosis\": {\n        \"name\": \"Acute coronary syndrome\",\n        \"confidence\": 0.6,\n        \"icd_code\": \"I24.9\"\n    },\n    \"differential_diagnoses\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Unstable angina\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.7,\n            \"icd_code\": \"I20.0\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Gastroesophageal reflux disease\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.5,\n            \"icd_code\": \"K21.9\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Pericarditis\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.4,\n            \"icd_code\": \"I30.9\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Pulmonary embolism\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.3,\n            \"icd_code\": \"I26.9\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Musculoskeletal chest pain\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.4,\n            \"icd_code\": \"M79.1\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"key_findings\": [\n        \"45-year-old patient\",\n        \"Chief complaint of chest pain\",\n        \"No additional clinical details provided\"\n    ],\n    \"tests\": [\n        {\n            \"test\": \"12-lead ECG\",\n            \"priority\": \"immediate\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Cardiac troponin\",\n            \"priority\": \"immediate\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Chest X-ray\",\n            \"priority\": \"urgent\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Complete blood count\",\n            \"priority\": \"routine\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Basic metabolic panel\",\n            \"priority\": \"routine\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"D-dimer\",\n            \"priority\": \"urgent\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"management\": {\n        \"immediate\": [\n            \"IV access\",\n            \"Continuous cardiac monitoring\",\n            \"Oxygen if hypoxic\",\n            \"Vital signs monitoring\"\n        ],\n        \"medications\": [\n            \"Aspirin: 325mg PO chewed\",\n            \"Nitroglycerin: 0.4mg SL if chest pain persists\"\n        ],\n        \"consultations\": [\n            \"Cardiology: urgent if ACS suspected\",\n            \"Emergency medicine: immediate\"\n        ]\n    },\n    \"red_flags\": [\n        \"Crushing or pressure-like chest pain\",\n        \"Radiation to left arm, jaw, or back\",\n        \"Associated shortness of breath\",\n        \"Diaphoresis or nausea\",\n        \"Hemodynamic instability\"\n    ]\n}\n```",
