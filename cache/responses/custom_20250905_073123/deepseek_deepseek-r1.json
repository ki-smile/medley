  "content": "Okay, let's tackle this medical case. So, the patient is a 45-year-old male with sudden onset chest pain. The pain is crushing, substernal, and radiates to the left arm. He's been sweating and nauseous for the past two hours. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the primary symptoms point towards a cardiac issue. The nature of the pain\u2014crushing, substernal, radiating\u2014is classic for a heart attack. The sweating (diaphoresis) and nausea are also common in myocardial infarction (MI). His medical history includes hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and a significant smoking history. All of these are major risk factors for coronary artery disease. Family history of MI at a young age adds to the risk.\n\nLooking at the physical exam: BP is elevated at 150/90, which is a bit high. Heart rate is 95, regular. Respiratory rate is slightly increased. O2 saturation is okay. Diaphoretic and anxious\u2014again, consistent with MI. The cardiovascular exam notes normal heart sounds, no murmurs, which might be surprising in an MI, but sometimes the physical exam can be unremarkable. Lungs are clear, so probably not a pulmonary issue like PE or pneumothorax.\n\nThe initial tests are key here. ECG shows ST elevation in II, III, and aVF. That's the inferior leads, so this is pointing towards an inferior wall MI. Troponin I and CK-MB are both elevated, which confirms myocardial injury. So putting this all together, the primary diagnosis is likely an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) of the inferior wall.\n\nDifferential diagnoses need to be considered. Aortic dissection could present with chest pain, but the pain is usually tearing and radiates to the back. However, without unequal BP or other signs, it's less likely. Pulmonary embolism might cause chest pain and tachycardia, but the ECG here shows ST elevation, which isn't typical. Unstable angina is possible, but the elevated troponin indicates actual infarction. Pericarditis could have ST elevation, but it's usually diffuse and may have PR depression. The ST elevation here is localized, making pericarditis less likely.\n\nFor tests, immediate ECG is already done. Need to monitor cardiac enzymes serially, maybe a chest X-ray to rule out other issues, echocardiogram to check for wall motion abnormalities, and a lipid profile given his history. The priority would be immediate for ECG and troponin, urgent for others.\n\nManagement: Immediate actions should be aspirin, nitroglycerin if BP allows, oxygen if needed (though his O2 is okay), and morphine for pain. Medications would include aspirin 325 mg chewable, clopidogrel loading dose, nitroglycerin sublingual, and statin. He needs a cardiology consult immediately for possible PCI. Also, blood pressure management given his hypertension.\n\nRed flags include the STEMI itself, elevated cardiac enzymes, and his risk factors. Need to act fast to reperfuse the myocardium.\n\nWait, but the ECG leads II, III, aVF are inferior. So the ICD-10 code for STEMI would be I21.29. For differentials, aortic dissection is I71.00, PE I26.99, Unstable angina I20.0, and pericarditis I01.0. Also, medications: beta-blocker like metoprolol if BP allows, but maybe hold off if there's heart failure. But the immediate meds would focus on antiplatelets, anticoagulants, statins.\n\nNeed to check if the patient has contraindications to any meds. Since he's on amlodipine, but no mention of contraindications. Heparin or another anticoagulant might be added. Also, considering his diabetes, but that's more for long-term management.\n\nSo putting it all into the JSON structure as specified. The confidence for STEMI is high, maybe 0.95. Differentials with lower confidence. Tests prioritized. Management steps as per guidelines for STEMI.\n\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\n    \"primary_diagnosis\": {\n        \"name\": \"ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (Inferior Wall)\",\n        \"confidence\": 0.95,\n        \"icd_code\": \"I21.29\"\n    },\n    \"differential_diagnoses\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Aortic Dissection\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.2,\n            \"icd_code\": \"I71.00\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Pulmonary Embolism\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.15,\n            \"icd_code\": \"I26.99\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Unstable Angina\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.1,\n            \"icd_code\": \"I20.0\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Acute Pericarditis\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.05,\n            \"icd_code\": \"I01.0\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"key_findings\": [\n        \"ST elevation in leads II, III, aVF\",\n        \"Elevated Troponin I and CK-MB\",\n        \"Crushing substernal chest pain with left arm radiation\",\n        \"Hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and smoking history\"\n    ],\n    \"tests\": [\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Serial Troponin I\",\n            \"priority\": \"immediate\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Repeat ECG\",\n            \"priority\": \"immediate\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Echocardiogram\",\n            \"priority\": \"urgent\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Chest X-ray\",\n            \"priority\": \"urgent\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Lipid Profile\",\n            \"priority\": \"routine\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"management\": {\n        \"immediate\": [\n            \"Aspirin 325 mg chewable\",\n            \"Nitroglycerin sublingual (if BP >90 mmHg systolic)\",\n            \"Oxygen therapy if O2 saturation <90%\",\n            \"Morphine IV for pain relief\"\n        ],\n        \"medications\": [\n            \"Aspirin: 162-325 mg chewable, oral\",\n            \"Clopidogrel: 600 mg loading dose, oral\",\n            \"Nitroglycerin: 0.4 mg every 5 minutes (max 3 doses), sublingual\",\n            \"Atorvastatin: 80 mg, oral\"\n        ],\n        \"consultations\": [\n            \"Cardiology: immediate (for cardiac catheterization)\",\n            \"Cardiothoracic Surgery: standby (if PCI unavailable)\"\n        ]\n    },\n    \"red_flags\": [\n        \"ST elevation on ECG\",\n        \"Elevated cardiac enzymes\",\n        \"High-risk history (diabetes, hypertension, smoking)\",\n        \"Diaphoresis and nausea\"\n    ]\n}\n```",
