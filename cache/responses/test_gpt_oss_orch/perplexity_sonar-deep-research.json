But the system prompt is telling me to write a comprehensive, 10,000-word research report following specific formatting guidelines.\n\n3. The personalization section says \"You should follow all our instructions, but below we may include user's personal requests.

The user is asking for JSON output only, but the system prompt requires me to write a 10,000-word research report in markdown format with specific citation requirements.\n\nLooking at the planning rules, I need to \"Always break it down into multiple steps\" and \"Make sure that your final report addresses all parts of the query\" and \"Remember to verbalize your plan in a way that users can follow along with your thought process.\"\n\nHowever, I also need to follow the output guidelines which say \"Your report must be precise, of high-quality, and written by an expert using an unbiased and journalistic tone.

This comprehensive analysis examines the multifaceted approach to chest pain evaluation, encompassing differential diagnosis, risk stratification, diagnostic methodologies, and evidence-based management protocols. The evaluation of chest pain requires systematic consideration of life-threatening conditions including acute coronary syndrome, aortic dissection, pulmonary embolism, and pneumothorax, while simultaneously identifying low-risk patients suitable for safe discharge. Contemporary risk assessment tools such as the HEART score have revolutionized patient stratification, enabling clinicians to identify patients with less than 3% risk of major adverse cardiac events within six weeks[8][11]. Advanced diagnostic modalities including high-sensitivity troponin assays, computed tomography angiography, and point-of-care ultrasound have enhanced diagnostic accuracy while reducing time to disposition. Treatment protocols emphasize early recognition of acute ischemic symptoms, prompt electrocardiographic evaluation within 10 minutes of presentation, and evidence-based pharmacological interventions including aspirin, nitroglycerin, and targeted antiplatelet therapy.\n\n## Pathophysiology and Differential Diagnosis of Chest Pain\n\n### Cardiac Etiologies and Mechanisms\n\nThe cardiac causes of chest pain encompass a broad spectrum of pathophysiological processes, each requiring distinct diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. Myocardial ischemia represents the most immediately life-threatening etiology, occurring when oxygen demand exceeds supply due to coronary artery obstruction or spasm[1]. The pathophysiology involves disruption of atherosclerotic plaques, leading to thrombus formation and subsequent vessel occlusion. This process can manifest as ST-elevation myocardial infarction, non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, or unstable angina, collectively termed acute coronary syndrome[5].\n\nAortic dissection constitutes another critical cardiac cause, characterized by separation of the aortic wall layers due to intimal tears[1]. The pathophysiology involves propagation of blood through the false lumen, potentially compromising branch vessel perfusion and causing organ ischemia. Type A dissections involving the ascending aorta require emergency surgical intervention, while Type B dissections may be managed medically with aggressive blood pressure control[4]. The classic presentation includes sudden onset severe ripping pain radiating to the back, though atypical presentations are common[10].\n\nPericarditis presents with inflammation of the pericardial sac, causing characteristic pleuritic chest pain that worsens with inspiration and improves with sitting forward[1]. The pathophysiology may involve viral infections, autoimmune processes, or post-cardiac injury syndromes. When complicated by pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade, hemodynamic compromise occurs due to impaired ventricular filling[4]. Myocarditis represents inflammation of the myocardium itself, potentially causing chest pain alongside heart failure symptoms and arrhythmias[10].\n\n### Pulmonary and Vascular Etiologies\n\nPulmonary embolism emerges as a critical differential diagnosis, particularly in patients with risk factors for venous thromboembolism[1]. The pathophysiology involves obstruction of pulmonary arteries by embolic material, typically originating from deep venous thrombosis. This results in increased pulmonary vascular resistance, right heart strain, and potential hemodynamic collapse in massive pulmonary embolism[18]. Clinical presentation often includes pleuritic chest pain, dyspnea, and tachycardia, though the classic triad occurs in a minority of patients[4].\n\nPneumothorax represents another immediately life-threatening pulmonary cause, occurring when air accumulates in the pleural space[1]. Tension pneumothorax develops when a one-way valve mechanism allows air entry but prevents exit, leading to progressive mediastinal shift and cardiovascular collapse[4]. The pathophysiology involves sudden onset severe unilateral pleuritic chest pain with respiratory distress. Primary spontaneous pneumothorax typically affects tall, thin young males, while secondary pneumothorax occurs in patients with underlying lung disease[10].\n\nPneumonia can present with chest pain, particularly when involving the pleura[1]. The pathophysiology involves inflammatory infiltration of pulmonary parenchyma, often accompanied by pleuritic pain due to pleural inflammation. Community-acquired pneumonia may present with chest pain alongside fever, productive cough, and dyspnea. Pulmonary hypertension may cause anginal-quality chest pain with exertion due to right heart strain and reduced coronary perfusion pressure[1].\n\n### Gastrointestinal and Other Non-Cardiac Causes\n\nGastrointestinal causes of chest pain include several conditions that can mimic cardiac pathology[1]. Gastroesophageal reflux disease causes chest pain through acid-induced esophageal irritation, often relieved by antacids. Esophageal spasm can produce crushing substernal chest pain indistinguishable from cardiac ischemia, sometimes responding to nitroglycerin administration[1]. Esophageal rupture represents a surgical emergency with high mortality, typically occurring after forceful vomiting or instrumentation[4].\n\nMusculoskeletal causes include costochondritis, which involves inflammation of the costochondral junctions, producing localized chest wall tenderness[1]. Intercostal muscle strain can occur following physical exertion or trauma, causing sharp chest pain worsened by movement or deep inspiration. Rib fractures, particularly in elderly patients or those with osteoporosis, can produce significant chest pain and respiratory compromise[1].\n\nPsychiatric causes, particularly anxiety disorders, can produce chest pain accompanied by palpitations, dyspnea, and diaphoresis[1]. The pathophysiology involves sympathetic nervous system activation, potentially mimicking cardiac ischemia. Panic attacks can produce intense chest discomfort lasting minutes to hours, often accompanied by a sense of impending doom. Somatization disorders may present with recurrent chest pain without identifiable organic cause[1].\n\n## Clinical Assessment and Risk Stratification\n\n### Historical Features and Physical Examination\n\nThe clinical evaluation of chest pain begins with systematic assessment of historical features that can differentiate between various etiologies[1]. Sudden onset severe pain suggests aortic dissection, pulmonary embolism, or pneumothorax, while gradually progressive pain may indicate myocardial ischemia[7]. The quality of pain provides important diagnostic clues, with crushing or pressure-like sensations suggesting cardiac ischemia, while sharp, pleuritic pain suggests pulmonary or pericardial causes[10].\n\nRadiation patterns offer valuable diagnostic information, with cardiac pain typically radiating to the left arm, jaw, neck, or epigastrium[12]. Aortic dissection pain characteristically radiates to the back, often described as tearing or ripping in quality[4]. The relationship of pain to ex",
