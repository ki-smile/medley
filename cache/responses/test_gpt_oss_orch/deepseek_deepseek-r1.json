  "content": "Okay, let's tackle this medical case. The patient is a 45-year-old presenting with chest pain. First, I need to consider possible diagnoses. Chest pain can be due to various causes, ranging from cardiac to musculoskeletal.\n\nThe primary diagnosis that comes to mind is acute coronary syndrome (ACS), which includes conditions like myocardial infarction. It's a critical condition, so the confidence might be around 0.4. The ICD-10 code for unstable angina is I20.0, but if it's a heart attack, it could be I21.9. Wait, the user wants specific codes. Let me confirm: Unstable angina is I20.0, and acute myocardial infarction is I21.9. Since the presentation is chest pain without more details, maybe start with unstable angina as primary, but note MI as a differential.\n\nFor differential diagnoses, I should list other possibilities. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is common, K21.9. Confidence around 0.2. Musculoskeletal chest pain, maybe costochondritis, M54.6. Pulmonary embolism (I26.9) is another serious one. Maybe pericarditis (I30.9) too. Let me check how many differentials: 3-5. So include ACS as primary, then GERD, PE, costochondritis, and pericarditis.\n\nKey findings: Chest pain description isn't given, but in a 45-year-old, risk factors like smoking, hypertension, or family history might be relevant. However, without that info, maybe note that chest pain is the main finding, but more details needed. Wait, the user says 'key findings' based on the presentation. Since the only info is age and chest pain, perhaps list \"Chest pain (location, quality, radiation not specified)\" as a key finding. Maybe also \"Patient age and presentation consistent with cardiac etiology.\" But maybe it's better to leave it general.\n\nTests: Immediate priority should be ECG and troponin to check for ACS. Then maybe a CTA for pulmonary embolism if suspected. Chest X-ray for other causes. Echocardiogram. Blood work like CBC, electrolytes. Immediate tests: ECG, troponin. Urgent: CTA chest, CXR, echocardiogram. Routine would be others like stress test or endoscopy for GERD.\n\nManagement: Immediate actions like aspirin, nitroglycerin, oxygen if needed. Medications: Aspirin 325 mg chewable, nitroglycerin 0.4 mg sublingual. For possible MI, beta-blockers, statins. Maybe morphine if pain is severe. Consultations: Cardiology immediately, GI for GERD if needed, but priority is cardiology first.\n\nRed flags: Signs like radiating pain, SOB, diaphoresis, hypotension, which indicate worse conditions like MI or PE.\n\nWait, the output needs specific ICD codes. Let me verify each one:\n\nPrimary diagnosis: Acute Coronary Syndrome (I20.0 for unstable angina, but sometimes ACS is a broader term. Alternatively, if it's MI, I21.9. But maybe safer to go with unstable angina as primary. Or perhaps the user expects CAD? Hmm. Alternatively, they might use I20.9 for angina unspecified. Let me check: I20.0 is unstable angina, I20.9 is angina pectoris, unspecified. Since the presentation is chest pain without more details, maybe the primary is \"Acute Coronary Syndrome\" with code I20.9. But some sources might code ACS as I24.9. Wait, ICD-10 for ACS: Acute coronary syndrome is represented by codes I20.0 (unstable angina), I21 (STEMI), I22 (subsequent STEMI), I24.9 (other acute ischemic heart diseases). Maybe for ACS, the code would be I24.9 if unspecified. Alternatively, if considering unstable angina as part of ACS, I20.0. Hmm, this is a bit tricky. Maybe the user expects the most appropriate code here. Let's proceed with I20.0 for unstable angina as primary, with a confidence of 0.4.\n\nDifferential diagnoses:\n\n1. Pulmonary embolism: I26.9\n2. Gastroesophageal reflux disease: K21.9\n3. Costochondritis: M54.6\n4. Pericarditis: I30.9\n\nWait, the user wants 3-5 differentials. Let's list four here. Confidences for differentials should add up logically, but it's okay if they don't sum to 1.0. So GERD at 0.2, PE at 0.2, costochondritis 0.15, pericarditis 0.05.\n\nTests: ECG and troponin immediate. Then CTA chest (urgent), CXR (urgent), echocardiogram (urgent). Maybe D-dimer? But if PE is a differential, CTA is better. Stress test might be routine. Endoscopy for GERD if needed.\n\nMedications: Aspirin 325 mg chewable, nitroglycerin 0.4 mg SL every 5 min x3. Maybe morphine 2-4 mg IV if pain unrelieved. Statins like atorvastatin 80 mg. Beta-blockers like metoprolol if hypertensive.\n\nConsultations: Cardiology immediate, GI (urgent if GERD suspected after tests), pulmonology if PE confirmed.\n\nRed flags: Sudden onset, SOB, syncope, hypotension, radiating pain.\n\nWait, the management section has medications as an array of \"drug: dose, route\". So for aspirin: \"Aspirin: 325 mg, chewable\". Nitroglycerin: \"Nitroglycerin: 0.4 mg, sublingual every 5 minutes x3\". But the user might want each medication as a separate entry, maybe including frequency. Hmm. The example says [\"drug: dose, route\"], so maybe only the initial dose. So:\n\n\"Aspirin: 325 mg, oral (chewable)\",\n\"Nitroglycerin: 0.4 mg, sublingual\",\n\"Morphine: 2-4 mg, intravenous (if pain unrelieved)\",\n\"Atorvastatin: 80 mg, oral\",\n\"Metoprolol: 25-50 mg, oral every 6-12 hours (if hypertensive or tachycardic)\"\n\nBut maybe keep it concise. The user might expect the most critical meds. So aspirin and nitroglycerin are immediate. The others can be added if necessary.\n\nConsultations: \"Cardiology: immediate\", \"Gastroenterology: urgent (if GERD suspected)\", \"Pulmonology: urgent (if PE confirmed)\".\n\nRed flags: \"Pain radiating to jaw/arm\", \"Dyspnea\", \"Hypotension\", \"Diaphoresis\", \"Syncope\".\n\nPutting it all together.\n\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\n    \"primary_diagnosis\": {\n        \"name\": \"Acute Coronary Syndrome\",\n        \"confidence\": 0.4,\n        \"icd_code\": \"I20.0\"\n    },\n    \"differential_diagnoses\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.2,\n            \"icd_code\": \"K21.9\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Pulmonary Embolism\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.2,\n            \"icd_code\": \"I26.9\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Costochondritis\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.15,\n            \"icd_code\": \"M54.6\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Pericarditis\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.05,\n            \"icd_code\": \"I30.9\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"key_findings\": [\n        \"Chest pain (location, quality, and radiation unspecified)\",\n        \"Age and presentation raising concern for cardiac etiology\"\n    ],\n    \"tests\": [\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Electrocardiogram (ECG)\",\n            \"priority\": \"immediate\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Troponin level\",\n            \"priority\": \"immediate\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"CT Angiography (CTA) of chest\",\n            \"priority\": \"urgent\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Chest X-ray\",\n            \"priority\": \"urgent\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Echocardiogram\",\n            \"priority\": \"urgent\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"management\": {\n        \"immediate\": [\n            \"Administer oxygen if hypoxic\",\n            \"Obtain IV access\",\n            \"Monitor cardiac rhythm\"\n        ],\n        \"medications\": [\n            \"Aspirin: 325 mg, chewable\",\n            \"Nitroglycerin: 0.4 mg, sublingual every 5 minutes x3\",\n            \"Morphine: 2-4 mg, intravenous (if pain unrelieved)\"\n        ],\n        \"consultations\": [\n            \"Cardiology: immediate\",\n            \"Gastroenterology: urgent (if GERD suspected)\",\n            \"Pulmonology: urgent (if PE confirmed)\"\n        ]\n    },\n    \"red_flags\": [\n        \"Pain radiating to jaw/left arm\",\n        \"Dyspnea\",\n        \"Hypotension (SBP <90 mmHg)\",\n        \"Diaphoresis\",\n        \"Syncope\"\n    ]\n}\n```",
