      "response": "Okay, let's tackle this medical case. The patient is a 28-year-old male of Mediterranean descent with recurrent fever episodes since childhood. His symptoms include severe abdominal pain, chest pain with breathing difficulties, and joint pain in the knees and ankles. Family history is significant with his father and uncle having similar issues. Labs during attacks show elevated CRP, ESR, and WBC, but he's asymptomatic between episodes.\n\nFirst, considering the recurrent nature, Mediterranean ethnicity, and family history, Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) comes to mind. FMF is an autosomal recessive disorder common in Mediterranean populations. Symptoms like periodic fevers, serositis (abdominal and chest pain), and arthritis fit. The elevated inflammatory markers during attacks and resolution between episodes support this. The ICD-10 code for FMF is E85.0. Confidence is high, maybe 0.95, given the classic presentation and family history.\n\nDifferential diagnoses should include other periodic fever syndromes. Mevalonate Kinase Deficiency (Hyper-IgD Syndrome) is another autoinflammatory disorder with similar symptoms. It's also more common in Europeans, but the Mediterranean link might be less strong. ICD-10 E85.8, confidence around 0.3. Then, Periodic Fever, Aphthous Stomatitis, Pharyngitis, Adenitis (PFAPA) Syndrome. It usually starts in childhood and has regular fever episodes, but typically lacks family history. ICD-10 G40.81, confidence 0.25. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) could present with joint pain and serositis, but usually has other systemic symptoms and positive autoantibodies. ICD-10 M32.9, lower confidence like 0.2. Lastly, Adult-Onset Still\u2019s Disease (AOSD), which has quotidian fevers, arthritis, and elevated inflammatory markers, but rashes and other features are common. ICD-10 M06.1, confidence 0.15.\n\nKey findings would be the recurrent episodic symptoms, Mediterranean background, family history, lab results during attacks, and asymptomatic periods between episodes.\n\nFor tests, genetic testing for MEFV mutations is crucial for FMF confirmation\u2014priority immediate. Also, serum IgD levels (for Hyper-IgD) and other autoinflammatory markers. Routine tests like CBC, CRP, ESR during an attack. If considering SLE, ANA and anti-dsDNA. For AOSD, ferritin levels. Maybe imaging like chest X-ray if pleuritic pain is present.\n\nImmediate management would involve counseling and monitoring during attacks. Colchicine is the mainstay for FMF prophylaxis, so starting that at 0.6 mg twice daily. NSAIDs like ibuprofen for pain. If severe, corticosteroids might be needed. Consult rheumatology urgently to confirm diagnosis and manage. Also, genetic counseling given the hereditary aspect.\n\nRed flags would be signs of amyloidosis (a complication of untreated FMF), severe organ involvement, or unresponsive symptoms indicating another diagnosis.\n\nNeed to make sure all ICD codes are correct. Checked FMF is E85.0, Hyper-IgD under E85.8, PFAPA under G40.81 (though some sources might use different codes), SLE M32.9, AOSD M06.1. Maybe double-check PFAPA's code, but I think G40.81 is correct. Doses for colchicine: standard is 0.5-2 mg daily, but starting at 0.6 mg BID. Medications should have doses specified. Tests prioritized as immediate for genetic testing. Consultations include rheumatology urgent. Red flags about amyloidosis and complications.\n\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\n    \"primary_diagnosis\": {\n        \"name\": \"Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF)\",\n        \"confidence\": 0.95,\n        \"icd_code\": \"E85.0\"\n    },\n    \"differential_diagnoses\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Mevalonate Kinase Deficiency (Hyper-IgD Syndrome)\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.3,\n            \"icd_code\": \"E85.8\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Periodic Fever, Aphthous Stomatitis, Pharyngitis, Adenitis (PFAPA) Syndrome\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.25,\n            \"icd_code\": \"G40.81\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.2,\n            \"icd_code\": \"M32.9\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Adult-Onset Still\u2019s Disease (AOSD)\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.15,\n            \"icd_code\": \"M06.1\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"key_findings\": [\n        \"Recurrent fever episodes since childhood\",\n        \"Mediterranean descent with family history of similar symptoms\",\n        \"Elevated CRP, ESR, and WBC during attacks\",\n        \"Abdominal, chest, and joint pain during episodes\",\n        \"Asymptomatic between attacks\"\n    ],\n    \"tests\": [\n        {\n            \"test\": \"MEFV gene mutation analysis (genetic testing)\",\n            \"priority\": \"immediate\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Serum IgD levels (for Hyper-IgD Syndrome)\",\n            \"priority\": \"urgent\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"CBC, CRP, ESR (during attack)\",\n            \"priority\": \"urgent\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"ANA and anti-dsDNA (for SLE)\",\n            \"priority\": \"routine\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Serum ferritin (for AOSD)\",\n            \"priority\": \"routine\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"management\": {\n        \"immediate\": [\n            \"Monitor for signs of amyloidosis (e.g., proteinuria)\",\n            \"Hydration and pain management during acute episodes\"\n        ],\n        \"medications\": [\n            \"colchicine: 0.6 mg PO twice daily (prophylaxis)\",\n            \"ibuprofen: 400-600 mg PO every 6 hours (pain/inflammation)\",\n            \"prednisone: 0.5-1 mg/kg/day PO during severe attacks (if unresponsive to NSAIDs)\"\n        ],\n        \"consultations\": [\n            \"rheumatology: urgent\",\n            \"genetic counseling: routine\"\n        ]\n    },\n    \"red_flags\": [\n        \"Proteinuria or renal dysfunction (suggests amyloidosis)\",\n        \"Persistent symptoms between attacks\",\n        \"Respiratory compromise during chest pain episodes\",\n        \"Unresponsive to colchicine therapy\"\n    ]\n}\n```",
