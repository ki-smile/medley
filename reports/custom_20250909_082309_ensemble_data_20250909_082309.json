      "response": "Okay, let's tackle this medical case. So, the patient is a 28-year-old male of Mediterranean descent with recurrent fever episodes, abdominal and chest pain, joint pain in knees and ankles, and a family history of similar symptoms in his father and uncle. The episodes last 1-3 days, happen every 2-3 weeks since childhood, and labs show elevated CRP, ESR, and WBC during attacks. He's asymptomatic between episodes. Genetic testing is pending.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the recurrent fever, family history, Mediterranean descent, and the triad of abdominal, chest, and joint pain. The family history suggests a hereditary condition. The periodic nature of the fevers makes me think of autoinflammatory syndromes. The most common one in Mediterranean populations is Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF). The symptoms align with FMF: recurrent fevers, serositis causing abdominal and chest pain, arthritis, and elevated inflammatory markers during attacks. The ICD-10 code for FMF is E85.0. Confidence is high here, so maybe 0.9.\n\nDifferential diagnoses: \n\n1. Periodic Fever Syndrome (other than FMF), like TNF receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS). But TRAPS typically has longer episodes (over a week), so maybe lower confidence. ICD-10 E85.8, confidence 0.3.\n\n2. Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (sJIA): presents with fever, joint pain, elevated inflammatory markers. But sJIA often has daily fevers and rashes, which aren't mentioned here. Maybe lower confidence, 0.25. ICD-10 M08.2.\n\n3. Beh\u00e7et's Disease: can cause recurrent oral ulcers, uveitis, and joint pain. But the patient doesn't mention mucosal lesions, so confidence low, 0.2. ICD-10 M35.2.\n\n4. Gout: unexpected here because of age and presentation, but joint pain in knees/ankles. However, fever and periodicity don't fit. Maybe 0.1. ICD-10 M10.9.\n\nTests: The genetic test for MEFV mutations is key for confirming FMF. Should be an immediate priority. Also, check serum amyloid A (SAA) for amyloidosis risk. ESR and CRP are already done, maybe repeat during next episode. Urinalysis for proteinuria. If considering Beh\u00e7et's, maybe HLA-B51 test, but that's lower priority. So genetic testing immediate, SAA urgent, urinalysis routine.\n\nManagement: Colchicine is first-line for FMF. Typical dose 0.5 mg twice daily. NSAIDs for acute pain. If colchicine ineffective, maybe anakinra. Consult rheumatology urgently. Monitor for amyloidosis.\n\nRed flags: Signs of amyloidosis like proteinuria, renal failure. Pericarditis or pleuritis complications. Severe abdominal pain could mimic acute abdomen, but in FMF it's self-limiting. Need to educate patient to seek care if new symptoms arise.\n\nSo putting this all together in the required JSON format, making sure to follow the structure. Check ICD codes for accuracy. Make sure medications include doses. Tests prioritized. Only 3-5 differentials. Confidence scores add up but don't need to sum to 1. Use immediate, urgent, routine for test priorities. Avoid markdown, just JSON.\n\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\n    \"primary_diagnosis\": {\n        \"name\": \"Familial Mediterranean Fever\",\n        \"confidence\": 0.9,\n        \"icd_code\": \"E85.0\"\n    },\n    \"differential_diagnoses\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"TNF receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS)\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.3,\n            \"icd_code\": \"E85.8\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.25,\n            \"icd_code\": \"M08.2\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Beh\u00e7et\u2019s Disease\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.2,\n            \"icd_code\": \"M35.2\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"key_findings\": [\n        \"Recurrent self-limiting fever episodes\",\n        \"Serositis (abdominal/chest pain)\",\n        \"Oligoarthritis (knees/ankles)\",\n        \"Family history in paternal lineage\",\n        \"Elevated CRP/ESR/WBC during attacks\"\n    ],\n    \"tests\": [\n        {\n            \"test\": \"MEFV gene mutation analysis\",\n            \"priority\": \"immediate\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Serum amyloid A (SAA) level\",\n            \"priority\": \"urgent\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Urinalysis for proteinuria\",\n            \"priority\": \"routine\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"management\": {\n        \"immediate\": [\"Rule out acute surgical abdomen during attacks\"],\n        \"medications\": [\n            \"colchicine: 0.5 mg PO twice daily\",\n            \"ibuprofen: 400-600 mg PO every 6-8 hours as needed (pain)\"\n        ],\n        \"consultations\": [\"Rheumatology: urgent\"]\n    },\n    \"red_flags\": [\n        \"Persistent fever >7 days\",\n        \"Proteinuria/nephrotic syndrome\",\n        \"Pericardial effusion\",\n        \"Neurologic deficits\"\n    ]\n}\n```",
