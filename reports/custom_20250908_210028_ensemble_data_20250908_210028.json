      "response": "Okay, let's tackle this medical case. So, the patient is a 28-year-old male of Mediterranean descent with recurrent fever episodes, abdominal and chest pain, joint pain, and a family history of similar symptoms. The episodes happen every 2-3 weeks, starting in childhood. During attacks, labs show elevated CRP, ESR, and WBC. Between episodes, he's asymptomatic.\n\nFirst, the Mediterranean background is a clue. Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) comes to mind immediately. FMF is an autosomal recessive disorder common in people from the Mediterranean region. It presents with recurrent fevers, serositis (which explains the abdominal and chest pain), arthritis (joint pain in knees and ankles), and family history. The labs during attacks showing inflammation markers up also fit. The episodic nature with complete resolution between attacks is classic for FMF. So FMF is the primary diagnosis here. Confidence is high, maybe 0.95. The ICD-10 code for FMF is E85.0.\n\nDifferential diagnoses need to consider other periodic fever syndromes. One is TRAPS (Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor-Associated Periodic Syndrome). It also causes recurrent fevers, abdominal pain, and has an autosomal dominant inheritance, which might fit the family history (father and uncle). But TRAPS episodes usually last longer, more than a week, while this patient's are 1-3 days. So confidence lower, maybe 0.4. ICD-10 is E85.1.\n\nAnother differential is HIDS (Hyper-IgD Syndrome), which is autosomal recessive, presents with fevers, abdominal pain, joint pain, and elevated inflammatory markers. However, HIDS typically starts in infancy and is associated with lymphadenopathy and elevated IgD levels. The patient's symptoms started at 7, so maybe not HIDS. Confidence around 0.3. ICD-10 E85.8.\n\nThird differential could be Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (SJIA). It presents with recurrent fevers, arthritis, and elevated inflammatory markers. But SJIA usually has daily fevers and rash (salmon-colored), which aren't mentioned here. So lower confidence, say 0.25. ICD-10 M08.2.\n\nFourth is Beh\u00e7et's disease, which can cause oral/genital ulcers, uveitis, and joint pain. But absence of mucosal ulcers makes this less likely. Confidence 0.2. ICD-10 M35.2.\n\nKey findings would include the recurrent short fevers, serositis symptoms (abdominal and chest pain), family history, Mediterranean ethnicity, elevated inflammatory markers during attacks, and asymptomatic periods between.\n\nTests: Genetic testing for MEFV mutations is critical for FMF. Since it's pending, maybe prioritize that as immediate. Also, serum IgD and IgA levels for HIDS. CRP and ESR during attacks are already done, so maybe check SAA (serum amyloid A) to assess for amyloidosis risk. Urinalysis for proteinuria (amyloidosis complication). For TRAPS, genetic testing for TNFRSF1A. So list MEFV test as immediate, then others as urgent or routine.\n\nManagement: Immediate should be managing acute attacks. Colchicine is the mainstay for FMF prophylaxis and treatment. Dose might be 0.5 mg twice daily. During acute attacks, maybe NSAIDs like ibuprofen for pain. Consult rheumatology urgently. Long-term, colchicine prevents attacks and amyloidosis. Red flags would be signs of amyloidosis like proteinuria, or if symptoms worsen despite treatment.\n\nSo putting it all together in the JSON structure as specified.\n\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\n    \"primary_diagnosis\": {\n        \"name\": \"Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF)\",\n        \"confidence\": 0.95,\n        \"icd_code\": \"E85.0\"\n    },\n    \"differential_diagnoses\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor-Associated Periodic Syndrome (TRAPS)\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.4,\n            \"icd_code\": \"E85.1\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Hyperimmunoglobulin D Syndrome (HIDS)\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.3,\n            \"icd_code\": \"E85.8\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (SJIA)\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.25,\n            \"icd_code\": \"M08.2\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Beh\u00e7et\u2019s Disease\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.2,\n            \"icd_code\": \"M35.2\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"key_findings\": [\n        \"Recurrent short-duration fever episodes\",\n        \"Serositis (abdominal/chest pain)\",\n        \"Family history in paternal lineage\",\n        \"Mediterranean descent\",\n        \"Elevated CRP/ESR/WBC during attacks\",\n        \"Asymptomatic between episodes\"\n    ],\n    \"tests\": [\n        {\n            \"test\": \"MEFV gene sequencing (confirm FMF)\",\n            \"priority\": \"immediate\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Serum IgD/IgA levels (evaluate for HIDS)\",\n            \"priority\": \"urgent\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"TNFRSF1A gene testing (evaluate TRAPS)\",\n            \"priority\": \"urgent\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Serum amyloid A (SAA) and urinalysis (assess amyloidosis risk)\",\n            \"priority\": \"routine\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"management\": {\n        \"immediate\": [\"Symptomatic relief with NSAIDs during attacks\"],\n        \"medications\": [\n            \"colchicine: 0.5 mg oral twice daily (prophylaxis)\",\n            \"ibuprofen: 400-600 mg oral every 6-8 hours as needed (pain/fever)\"\n        ],\n        \"consultations\": [\"rheumatology: urgent\"]\n    },\n    \"red_flags\": [\n        \"Persistent proteinuria (possible amyloidosis)\",\n        \"Prolonged fever or symptoms between episodes\",\n        \"Neurological deficits or vision changes\"\n    ]\n}\n```",
