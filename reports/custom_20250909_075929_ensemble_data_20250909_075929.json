      "response": "Okay, let's tackle this medical case. So, the patient is a 28-year-old male of Mediterranean descent with recurrent fever episodes, abdominal pain, chest pain with breathing difficulties, and joint pain in knees and ankles. The episodes last 1-3 days and occur every 2-3 weeks since childhood. Family history includes father and paternal uncle with similar symptoms. Labs during attacks show elevated CRP, ESR, and WBC. Asymptomatic between episodes. Genetic testing is pending.\n\nFirst, the Mediterranean ancestry makes me think of Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF). FMF is an autosomal recessive disorder common in that population. Symptoms like recurrent fevers, serositis (abdominal, chest pain), joint involvement, and family history fit. Elevation of inflammatory markers during attacks and being asymptomatic between episodes also align. The ICD-10 for FMF is E85.0. Confidence here is high, maybe 0.9, considering the presentation and family history, but pending genetic test.\n\nDifferential diagnoses need 3-5. Let's see. One could be Periodic Fever Syndrome, but FMF is a type of that. Maybe another periodic fever syndrome like TNF receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS). TRAPS has longer episodes though, more than a week. But given that the episodes here are 1-3 days, maybe not. Still, it's a differential. ICD-10 for TRAPS is E85.1. Confidence lower, maybe 0.2.\n\nNext, Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). Lupus can cause fever, joint pain, serositis. But the episodic nature and family history leaning towards FMF make SLE less likely. But still possible. ICD-10 M32.9. Confidence around 0.15.\n\nAnother possibility is Beh\u00e7et\u2019s Disease. It can cause oral ulcers, genital ulcers, uveitis, but here the main symptoms are fever and serositis. Maybe not the best fit. However, joint pain and familial occurrence might be considered. ICD-10 M35.2. Confidence lower, 0.1.\n\nInfectious causes like recurrent peritonitis, but given the periodicity and family history, it's less likely. Maybe appendicitis, but it's recurrent which is unusual. So maybe not.\n\nFor tests: genetic testing for MEFV mutations is key for confirming FMF. Priority immediate. Also, serum amyloid A (SAA) to check for amyloidosis risk. Urinalysis to check proteinuria. CRP and ESR are already done during attacks. Maybe imaging like abdominal ultrasound during attack, but priority routine.\n\nManagement: colchicine is the mainstay for FMF. Dose is 0.5 mg twice daily. Can increase if needed. NSAIDs for pain. Immediate management would be pain control and monitoring. Consult rheumatology urgently. \n\nRed flags: signs of amyloidosis (proteinuria), prolonged fever, or symptoms not resolving with colchicine.\n\nDifferential diagnoses could also include Adult-Onset Still\u2019s Disease (AOSD), but that usually has quotidian fever and rash. Maybe Hyper IgD syndrome (HIDS), but more common in Northern Europeans. So TRAPS, SLE, Beh\u00e7et's, maybe HIDS as differentials. Let me check ICD codes for HIDS: E85.8 (other amyloidosis?) Hmm, maybe E85.8. Wait, HIDS is a mevalonate kinase deficiency, so perhaps E88.81. Not sure. Maybe better to include TRAPS, SLE, and Beh\u00e7et's.\n\nTests: genetic tests (MEFV, TNFRSF1A), SAA, urinalysis, maybe others. So finalizing the JSON with these elements.\n\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\n    \"primary_diagnosis\": {\n        \"name\": \"Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF)\",\n        \"confidence\": 0.9,\n        \"icd_code\": \"E85.0\"\n    },\n    \"differential_diagnoses\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"TNF receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS)\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.2,\n            \"icd_code\": \"E85.1\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.15,\n            \"icd_code\": \"M32.9\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Beh\u00e7et\u2019s Disease\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.1,\n            \"icd_code\": \"M35.2\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"key_findings\": [\n        \"Recurrent self-limiting fever episodes\",\n        \"Serositis (abdominal/chest pain)\",\n        \"Ethnicity and family history\",\n        \"Elevated CRP/ESR/WBC during attacks\",\n        \"Asymptomatic between episodes\"\n    ],\n    \"tests\": [\n        {\n            \"test\": \"MEFV gene mutation analysis\",\n            \"priority\": \"immediate\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Serum amyloid A (SAA)\",\n            \"priority\": \"urgent\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Urinalysis for proteinuria\",\n            \"priority\": \"urgent\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"TNFRSF1A gene testing (for TRAPS)\",\n            \"priority\": \"routine\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"management\": {\n        \"immediate\": [\"Pain management with NSAIDs\", \"Monitor for complications (e.g., serositis)\"],\n        \"medications\": [\"colchicine: 0.5 mg PO twice daily\", \"ibuprofen: 400-600 mg PO every 6-8 hours as needed\"],\n        \"consultations\": [\"Rheumatology: urgent\", \"Geneticist: routine\"]\n    },\n    \"red_flags\": [\n        \"Persistent proteinuria (possible amyloidosis)\",\n        \"Prolonged fever >7 days\",\n        \"New neurological symptoms\",\n        \"Failure to respond to colchicine\"\n    ]\n}\n```",

The case: 28-year-old male Mediterranean descent, recurrent fever episodes 1-3 days, abdominal pain, chest pain with breathing difficulties (maybe pleuritic), joint pain knees and ankles, family history father and paternal uncle similar symptoms, episodes every 2-3 weeks, labs: elevated CRP, ESR, WBC during attack, asymptomatic between attacks. Started childhood age 7. Genetic testing pending. Likely Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF). Primary diagnosis: Familial Mediterranean Fever, ICD-10 code: M34.3 (Familial Mediterranean fever). Confidence high maybe 0.95.\n\nDifferential diagnoses: 3-5. Could include:\n\n- Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (still, but less likely). ICD-10 code: M08.0? Actually systemic JIA is M08.0. Confidence maybe 0.3.\n\n- Adult-onset Still disease: ICD-10 M06.4. Confidence 0.3.\n\n- Seronegative inflammatory arthritis (e.g., reactive arthritis). Confidence 0.2.\n\n- Viral causes (EBV, CMV) but less likely. Confidence 0.1.\n\n- Autoinflammatory disease other than FMF: e.g., TRAPS (TNF receptor-associated periodic syndrome) ICD-10: M34.1. Confidence 0.2.\n\n- Maybe peritonitis due to other cause. But keep within 3-5.\n\nKey findings: Recurrent febrile episodes, abdominal pain, chest pain, migratory polyarthritis, elevated acute phase reactants, family history, Mediterranean descent, asymptomatic between attacks, onset childhood, genetic test pending.\n\nTests: Genetic testing for MEFV gene mutation (urgent). Also baseline labs: CBC, ESR, CRP, serum amyloid A, serum amyloid A (SAA) urgent. Complement levels? Maybe. Ultrasound of abdomen? Not urgent. Get baseline amyloid A to assess risk of amyloidosis. Also consider chest imaging? Not urgent. Also consider kidney function? routine.\n\nPriority: Immediate: Genetic testing for MEFV; urgent: serum amyloid A, baseline labs; routine: abdominal ultrasound, chest X-ray, complete metabolic panel.\n\nManagement: Immediate: NSAIDs for pain and fever; colchicine prophylaxis (dosing: 1 mg orally twice daily for adults; adjust for GI intolerance). Also consider steroid short courses for attacks (dexamethasone 4 mg IV q24h). Also consider prophylactic colchicine. Also consider NSAID of choice: ibuprofen 400 mg PO q6h PRN. Provide specific medication doses: colchicine 1 mg PO BID; ibuprofen 400 mg PO q6h PRN; prednisone 10 mg PO daily for 3 days? Actually for FMF acute attack, sometimes prednisone 10-20 mg PO for 3 days. But typical is colchicine prophylaxis first line.\n\nConsultations: Rheumatology urgent; genetics perhaps; neurology? Not needed. So: Rheumatology: urgent; Genetics: routine.\n\nRed flags: Recurrent fever with abdominal pain could be mesenteric ischemia? But in FMF risk of amyloidosis: renal involvement, proteinuria. Also risk of aortic root dilation? Not typical. Red flags: persistent fever >48h, weight loss, new organ involvement, or failure to respond to colchicine, or amyloidosis signs (proteinuria), or chest pain with breathing difficulties could be pleuritis but also could be pulmonary embolism. So mention: unexplained persistent fever >48h, progressive organ dysfunction, weight loss, new rash, or failure to respond to colchicine. Also mention: severe abdominal pain could indicate perforation. But keep simple.\n\nReturn JSON only. Ensure formatting. Provide confidence values. Provide ICD-10 codes.
