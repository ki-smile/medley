      "response": "We need to analyze case: 28-year-old male, Mediterranean descent, recurrent fevers 1-3 days, severe abdominal pain, chest pain with breathing difficulties, joint pain (knees, ankles), family history (father, paternal uncle similar), episodes every 2-3 weeks, labs during attack: elevated CRP, ESR, WBC, asymptomatic between attacks, symptoms started at age 7. Suspicious for Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF). Primary diagnosis FMF. ICD-10 code: M08.1? Actually FMF code: M08.1 Familial Mediterranean fever, M08.1 is not; Wait: M08.1 is Familial Mediterranean fever? Let's check: M08.0 is Familial arthropathy, M08.1 is Familial Mediterranean fever, yes. So use M08.1.\n\nDifferential: other periodic fever syndromes: TRAPS (TNF receptor-associated periodic syndrome) - ICD-10 code: M08.5? Actually TRAPS is M08.2? Wait: TRAPS (TNFRSF1A-related periodic syndrome) code M08.3? Let's check: M08.3 is TNF receptor-associated periodic syndrome. Also consider PFAPA (periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, adenitis) - ICD-10: R50.2? Actually R50.2 is other specified fever of unknown origin? But PFAPA is R50.2? Might be R50.2? There's R50.2 \"Other specified fever\". But could use R50.2. Also consider systemic autoinflammatory diseases: Cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome (CAPS) - M08.4? Actually CAPS is M08.4. Also consider VEXAS? But less likely. Also consider reactive arthritis? Or viral infections? But given periodic and family, FMF high.\n\nKey findings: recurrent fevers 1-3 days, serositis (abdominal, pleural pain), arthritis (knees, ankles), elevated acute phase reactants, family history, Mediterranean ancestry, attack periodicity 2-3 weeks, asymptomatic inter-attack.\n\nTests: Genetic testing for MEFV gene (FMF) - priority urgent. Also baseline labs: CBC, ESR, CRP, serum amyloid A (SAA) - urgent. Complement levels? But not necessary. Also look for amyloidosis: renal function, proteinuria, urinalysis - routine? Might be routine. Also trial of colchicine response? But test: colchicine trial? Might be part of management.\n\nWe need to provide tests by priority: immediate: Genetic testing for MEFV. Also urgent: baseline labs, SAA. Routine: renal function, urinalysis, imaging if needed.\n\nManagement: immediate: start colchicine prophylaxis 1.2 mg daily (dose can be 1.2 mg twice daily?) Actually typical: 1.2 mg once daily for adults, can increase to 1.5 mg daily if tolerated. Provide if tolerated. Also NSAIDs for acute attacks. Provide immediate: NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen 400 mg PO q8h) for pain, colchicine 1.2 mg PO daily. Also consider corticosteroids for severe attacks; but colchicine is main. Also give patient instructions to take colchicine at first sign of fever. Also vaccinations? Possibly not.\n\nMedications: colchicine: 1.2 mg PO daily; can increase to 1.5 mg daily. Also consider NSAIDs: ibuprofen 400-600 mg PO q8h. For severe attacks: prednisone 50 mg PO daily for 3 days. But we need specific medication doses. Use typical dosage: colchicine 1.2 mg PO daily; ibuprofen 400 mg PO q8h PRN. Prednisone 40-60 mg PO daily for 3 days if severe attack. Also consider anakinra? In refractory? But not first-line.\n\nConsultations: Rheumatology (urgent). Also consider genetics? But rheumatology is priority. Also consider Gastroenterology if abdominal? But rheumatology first.\n\nRed flags: progressive amyloidosis, persistent high CRP, severe organ involvement, severe pain not responding to colchicine, risk of complications.\n\nReturn JSON only. Ensure fields. Provide confidence: high for FMF: 0.95. Differential: TRAPS 0.6, PFAPA 0.3, CAPS 0.4 (maybe 0.5?), reactive arthritis 0.2. Provide ICD codes.\n\nLet's craft JSON.\n\n---\n\n{\n    \"primary_diagnosis\": {\n        \"name\": \"Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF)\",\n        \"confidence\": 0.95,\n        \"icd_code\": \"M08.1\"\n    },\n    \"differential_diagnoses\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"TNF Receptor-Associated Periodic Syndrome (TRAPS)\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.60,\n            \"icd_code\": \"M08.3\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndromes (CAPS)\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.50,\n            \"icd_code\": \"M08.4\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"PFAPA Syndrome (Periodic Fever, Aphthous Stomatitis, Pharyngitis, Adenitis)\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.30,\n            \"icd_code\": \"R50.2\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Reactive Arthritis\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.20,\n            \"icd_code\": \"M08.5\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"key_findings\": [\n        \"Recurrent fever episodes lasting 1\u20133 days\",\n        \"Serositis with abdominal and pleuritic chest pain\",\n        \"Peripheral arthritis involving knees and ankles\",\n        \"Elevated CRP, ESR, and leukocytosis during attacks\",\n        \"Asymptomatic inter\u2011attack periods\",\n        \"Positive family history in Mediterranean ancestry\"\n    ],\n    \"tests\": [\n        {\n            \"test\": \"MEFV gene sequencing (FMF panel)\",\n            \"priority\": \"urgent\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Serum Amyloid A (SAA) concentration\",\n            \"priority\": \"urgent\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Baseline CBC, ESR, CRP, renal panel, urinalysis (proteinuria screen)\",\n            \"priority\": \"immediate\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Renal imaging (ultrasound) if proteinuria >1 g/day\",\n            \"priority\": \"routine\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Trial of colchicine response (clinical monitoring over 4\u20136 weeks)\",\n            \"priority\": \"routine\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"management\": {\n        \"immediate\": [\n            \"Start colchicine 1.2 mg PO once daily (can be increased to 1.5 mg if tolerated)\",\n            \"Administer NSAID (ibuprofen 400 mg PO q8h PRN) for acute pain\",\n            \"Provide patient education on early colchicine initiation at first fever sign\"\n        ],\n        \"medications\": [\n            \"colchicine: 1.2 mg PO daily (adjust to 1.5 mg if well tolerated)\",\n            \"ibuprofen: 400 mg PO every 8 hours PRN for pain\",\n            \"prednisone: 40\u201360 mg PO daily for 3 days during severe attacks if colchicine ineffective\",\n            \"hydroxychloroquine 200 mg PO daily (consider if colchicine intolerant or for amyloidosis prevention)\",\n            \"anakinra 100 mg SC daily (consider in colchicine\u2011resistant cases)\"\n        ],\n        \"consultations\": [\n            \"rheumatology: urgent referral for disease management\",\n            \"genetics: urgent referral for familial mutation analysis\",\n            \"gastroenterology: routine if abdominal pain persists beyond serositis\"\n        ]\n    },\n    \"red_flags\": [\n        \"Progressive proteinuria or declining renal function\",\n        \"Persistently elevated SAA despite colchicine therapy\",\n        \"Severe or refractory attacks despite maximal colchicine dose\",\n        \"Development of amyloidosis symptoms (e.g., nephrotic syndrome, unexplained fatigue)\",\n        \"Neurological symptoms suggestive of CAPS (e.g., headache, sensorineural hearing loss)\"\n    ]\n}",
