      "response": "We need to analyze this case. The patient is a 28-year-old male, Mediterranean descent, with recurrent fever, abdominal pain, chest pain with breathing difficulty, joint pain affecting knees and ankles, episodes every 2-3 weeks, started in childhood (~7), family history of similar symptoms in father and paternal uncle. Labs during attacks show elevated CRP, ESR, WBC. Asymptomatic between attacks. Recent genetic testing pending. This suggests possibly familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) or other autoinflammatory syndromes like TNF receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS), or periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, adenitis (PFAPA), but PFAPA typically in children, not long. In Mediterranean descent, FMF is classic. So primary diagnosis: Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF). ICD-10 code: M04.0? Wait, the code for Familial Mediterranean Fever is M04.0? Actually, M04.0 is \"Familial Mediterranean fever\". Let's confirm: In ICD-10, M04.0 is \"Familial Mediterranean fever\". Good.\n\nDifferential diagnoses:\n\n1. TNF receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS) - M34.7? Actually, TRAPS is M34.7? Wait, TRAPS is M34.7 \"TRAPS\" maybe. Let's check: M34.7 is \"TRAPS\". Yes.\n\n2. Hyperimmunoglobulinemia D with periodic fever syndrome (HIDS) - M34.8? Actually, HIDS is M34.8 \"Other autoinflammatory diseases of the immune system\". But maybe M34.8 includes other autoinflammatory. But we can use M34.8 as code. Or we can use M34.8 for \"Other autoinflammatory diseases of the immune system\".\n\n3. Acute interstitial nephritis? Not relevant.\n\nBetter to choose: PFAPA syndrome (M34.8 too). But PFAPA is M34.8? Actually, PFAPA is M34.8 as well? Hmm. Actually, PFAPA is M34.8 \"Other autoinflammatory diseases of the immune system\". So we can use same code but differentiate with description.\n\n4. Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) - M04.1? Actually, JIA is M04.1? Wait, M04.1 is \"Juvenile idiopathic arthritis, systemic type\". But that is less likely. But we can keep.\n\n5. Beh\u00e7et disease? But no eye involvement.\n\nBut we need 3-5 differential diagnoses. I'd include:\n\n- TNF receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS) - M34.7\n- Hyperimmunoglobulinemia D with periodic fever syndrome (HIDS) - M34.8\n- PFAPA syndrome - M34.8 (but maybe M34.8 again? We can note same code but differentiate)\n- Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA) - M04.1 (though less likely)\n- Acute pericarditis? But not likely.\n\nBetter: \"Sarcoidosis\" but no.\n\nThe key findings: recurrent fever, abdominal pain, chest pain with breathing difficulty, arthralgia knees/ankles, elevated inflammatory markers, family history, Mediterranean descent, episodic nature.\n\nTests: Genetic testing for MEFV gene (familial Mediterranean fever), CRP, ESR, WBC already done. Next tests: Serum amyloid A, abdominal imaging maybe ultrasound, chest imaging, ECG, echocardiogram, complete blood count, serum complement levels, serum immunoglobulins, HLA-B27? Not needed. Also consider test for TRAPS gene (TNFRSF1A). So tests: Genetic testing for MEFV (immediate), Serum amyloid A (urgent), abdominal ultrasound (routine), chest X-ray (routine), echocardiogram (routine). Also consider evaluation for amyloidosis: Serum and urine protein electrophoresis? But that's routine.\n\nManagement: Immediate: NSAIDs, colchicine prophylaxis. Colchicine dosage: 0.6 mg twice daily (for adult). For severe pain, can give 1.2 mg dosage? Actually standard: 0.6 mg twice daily. If renal impairment, adjust. Also consider steroids for acute attacks? But colchicine is first-line. Also consider anakinra (IL-1 receptor antagonist) if colchicine fails. So immediate: colchicine 0.6 mg twice daily, NSAIDs (ibuprofen 400-600 mg q6h). Also consider high-dose colchicine for attack. Also consider corticosteroids for acute exacerbations if severe: prednisolone 40-60 mg/day short course.\n\nMedications: colchicine 0.6 mg twice daily, ibuprofen 400 mg q6h PRN, prednisolone 20-40 mg/day for 3-5 days if severe. Also consider anakinra 100 mg subcut daily if refractory.\n\nConsultations: Rheumatology (urgent), Infectious disease (if needed), Genetic counseling (routine). Also gastroenterology if abdominal pain suspected to be due to other cause? But we can list rheumatology urgent.\n\nRed flags: Recurrent fever, chest pain with breathing difficulty, risk of amyloidosis, potential life-threatening complications like pericarditis, peritonitis, renal involvement.\n\nReturn JSON only.\n\nWe need to provide confidence values. For FMF: high confidence maybe 0.95. For TRAPS: 0.3. For HIDS: 0.2. For PFAPA: 0.15. For SJIA: 0.1. Provide ICD-10 codes.\n\nNow produce JSON.\n\nMake sure keys: \"primary_diagnosis\" object, \"differential_diagnoses\" array, \"key_findings\" array, \"tests\" array of objects with test and priority, \"management\" object with \"immediate\" array, \"medications\" array of string \"drug: dose, route\", \"consultations\" array, \"red_flags\" array.\n\nLet's craft.\n\nUse \"immediate\" for tests: Genetic testing for MEFV gene, Serum Amyloid A, maybe high-sensitivity CRP. \"urgent\": ESR? Already done.\n\n\"routine\": Abdominal ultrasound, chest X-ray, echocardiogram, renal function, ANA, complement.\n\nBut we need priority: immediate|urgent|routine.
