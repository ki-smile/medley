      "response": "Okay, let me try to work through this case step by step. The patient is a 28-year-old male of Mediterranean descent with recurrent fever episodes, abdominal and chest pain, joint pain, and a family history of similar symptoms in his father and uncle. The episodes last 1-3 days, happen every 2-3 weeks, and started in childhood. Labs during attacks show elevated CRP, ESR, and WBC. Between episodes, he's asymptomatic.\n\nFirst, considering the recurrent fevers and family history, I think of periodic fever syndromes. Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) comes to mind immediately because of the Mediterranean background. FMF typically presents with recurrent fever, serositis (abdominal and chest pain), arthritis, and elevated inflammatory markers. The autosomal recessive inheritance fits with the paternal family history (if the father and uncle are carriers or affected), but I need to check if FMF usually presents in childhood. Yes, onset is often before age 10, which matches the patient's history starting at 7. The duration of episodes in FMF is usually 1-3 days, so that lines up. The ICD-10 code for FMF is E85.0.\n\nDifferential diagnoses should include other autoinflammatory diseases. TRAPS (Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor-Associated Periodic Syndrome) is another periodic fever syndrome. It has longer episodes (often more than 5 days), but since the patient's episodes are 1-3 days, maybe lower confidence. However, TRAPS can present with similar symptoms. ICD-10 is E85.1.\n\nHyperimmunoglobulin D syndrome (HIDS) caused by mevalonate kinase deficiency could also be considered. It's also recurrent fever with abdominal pain and joint involvement. Attacks might be triggered by vaccines or stress, and they usually last longer (3-7 days), so maybe lower confidence here. ICD-10 is E85.8.\n\nBeh\u00e7et's disease is another possibility, but it's more common in Mediterranean and Middle Eastern populations. Symptoms include oral/genital ulcers, which aren't mentioned here. However, joint pain and other symptoms could overlap. Since the patient doesn't report ulcers, confidence is lower. ICD-10 is M35.2.\n\nFor tests, genetic testing for MEFV mutations is key for FMF. Since the patient's genetic testing is pending, that's a high priority. Also, serum immunoglobulin D and mevalonic acid for HIDS. Checking SAA (serum amyloid A) to assess amyloidosis risk. CRP and ESR are already done during attacks, so maybe not needed again unless to monitor.\n\nManagement-wise, during acute attacks, NSAIDs for pain and inflammation. Colchicine is the mainstay for prophylaxis in FMF. The usual dose is 0.6 mg twice daily orally. If colchicine isn't effective, maybe biologics like anakinra. Consult rheumatology for confirmation and management.\n\nRed flags would be signs of organ damage like renal issues from amyloidosis, which can be a complication of untreated FMF. Also, if chest pain becomes severe, ruling out pericarditis or pleurisy complications.\n\nWait, the family history includes father and paternal uncle. FMF is autosomal recessive, so having affected family members on the same side might indicate carriers if not both parents are carriers. But sometimes the inheritance can be more complex. The presence in the father and uncle might suggest an autosomal dominant condition, but FMF is usually recessive. Hmm, maybe the patient has a different mutation or another condition. However, the clinical picture still strongly suggests FMF. Possibly the family members are carriers with some symptoms, or maybe it's a different inheritance pattern. Still, the combination of ethnicity, symptoms, and family history makes FMF the top diagnosis.\n\nDifferential diagnoses should also include Muckle-Wells syndrome (part of the cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes), but that usually has urticaria and sensorineural hearing loss, which aren't mentioned here. Maybe less likely.\n\nSo the primary diagnosis is FMF with high confidence, maybe 0.9. Differentials: TRAPS (0.3), HIDS (0.25), Beh\u00e7et's (0.15). Tests include genetic testing (MEFV) as immediate, serum IgD, SAA. Management with colchicine. Consult rheumatology urgently.\n\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\n    \"primary_diagnosis\": {\n        \"name\": \"Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF)\",\n        \"confidence\": 0.9,\n        \"icd_code\": \"E85.0\"\n    },\n    \"differential_diagnoses\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor-Associated Periodic Syndrome (TRAPS)\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.3,\n            \"icd_code\": \"E85.1\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Hyperimmunoglobulin D Syndrome (HIDS)\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.25,\n            \"icd_code\": \"E85.8\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Beh\u00e7et\u2019s Disease\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.15,\n            \"icd_code\": \"M35.2\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"key_findings\": [\n        \"Recurrent self-limiting fever episodes\",\n        \"Mediterranean descent with family history of similar symptoms\",\n        \"Serositis (abdominal/chest pain) and arthritis\",\n        \"Elevated CRP/ESR/WBC during attacks\",\n        \"Asymptomatic between episodes\"\n    ],\n    \"tests\": [\n        {\n            \"test\": \"MEFV gene mutation analysis\",\n            \"priority\": \"immediate\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Serum immunoglobulin D (IgD) and mevalonic acid\",\n            \"priority\": \"urgent\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Serum amyloid A (SAA) level\",\n            \"priority\": \"urgent\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"management\": {\n        \"immediate\": [\"Symptomatic relief with NSAIDs during attacks\"],\n        \"medications\": [\"Colchicine: 0.6 mg PO twice daily (prophylaxis)\"],\n        \"consultations\": [\"Rheumatology: urgent\"]\n    },\n    \"red_flags\": [\n        \"Signs of amyloidosis (proteinuria, renal dysfunction)\",\n        \"Persistent chest pain/shortness of breath (pleuritis/pericarditis)\",\n        \"Unresponsive to colchicine (suggests alternate diagnosis)\"\n    ]\n}\n```",
