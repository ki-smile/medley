      "response": "We need to analyze case: 28-year-old male Mediterranean descent, recurrent fevers lasting 1-3 days, severe abdominal pain during episodes, chest pain with breathing difficulties, joint pain affecting knees and ankles. Family history: father and paternal uncle similar. Episodes every 2-3 weeks. Labs during attack: elevated CRP, ESR, WBC. Inter-attack asymptomatic. Started childhood age 7. Genetic testing pending.\n\nThis is classic periodic fever syndromes. Mediterranean descent, familial, recurrent fevers, abdominal pain, chest pain with breathing difficulties (pleuritic?), joint pain, family history. Likely Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF). Genetic testing pending for MEFV gene. So primary diagnosis: Familial Mediterranean Fever. Confidence maybe 0.9. ICD-10 code: M04.1 or M04.0? Actually FMF is M04.0 \"Familial Mediterranean fever\". But also ICD-10 code for FMF is M04.0? Let's confirm: M04.0 = Familial Mediterranean fever. Yes. So use that.\n\nDifferential diagnoses: could include:\n\n- TRAPS (TNF receptor-associated periodic syndrome) (ICD-10: M04.8? Actually M04.2? Wait M04.2 is TRAPS. Let's look: M04.2 = \"TNF-receptor associated periodic syndrome\". We'll include.\n\n- Hyper IgD syndrome (mevalonate kinase deficiency) (ICD-10: M04.3? Actually M04.3 is Hyper IgD syndrome. But we can use M04.3.)\n\n- Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (Still's disease) (ICD-10: M08.0? Actually M08.0 is systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis. But we can consider that as differential.\n\n- Recurrent pericarditis? But maybe not.\n\n- Acute rheumatic fever? But no.\n\n- Periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, adenitis (PFAPA) (ICD-10: M08.9? Not sure. But we can list PFAPA as differential, code M08.9 maybe.\n\n- Infectious causes? but labs show high inflammatory markers. We can also mention \"Serum sickness\" or \"Autoimmune vasculitis\" etc. But we need 3-5 differential diagnoses.\n\nAlso \"Serum sickness-like reaction\" (M34.0? Not sure). But we can stick with periodic fever syndromes.\n\nKey findings: recurrent fevers, abdominal pain, chest pain pleuritic, joint pain, elevated CRP, ESR, WBC, family history, asymptomatic between attacks, Mediterranean descent.\n\nTests: Genetic testing for MEFV, TNFRSF1A, MVK, NLRP3. Also CBC, ESR, CRP; serum amyloid A; complement levels; imaging? UA? But priority: immediate: CRP, ESR, CBC, serum amyloid A if available? But most urgent: Genetic testing for FMF (MEFV). Also check for serum amyloid A to evaluate risk of amyloidosis. Also consider abdominal imaging if abdominal pain >? but not urgent. So list tests: \"MEFV gene analysis\" priority immediate/urgent. \"TNFRSF1A gene analysis\" urgent. \"MVK gene analysis\" routine. \"Serum amyloid A\" urgent. \"CBC with diff\" immediate. \"ESR, CRP\" immediate. \"Complement C3, C4\" routine. \"Abdominal ultrasound\" routine.\n\nManagement: Immediate: supportive care during attack: NSAIDs, colchicine prophylaxis. Medications: Colchicine 0.5 mg twice daily (or 0.6 mg) for prophylaxis; during attack maybe give colchicine 1.5 mg (max 1.2 mg? Actually colchicine dosing: 0.5 mg twice daily; maximum 1.5 mg/day. For acute attack: 1.2 mg at onset, then 0.6 mg every 8 hours? But we can give \"Colchicine: 0.5 mg PO twice daily\". \"NSAIDs: Ibuprofen 400-600 mg PO q6-8h PRN\". \"Prednisone: 30-40 mg PO daily for 3-5 days\" if severe. Consultations: Rheumatology urgent. Infectious disease if suspect infection. Genetic counseling.\n\nRed flags: amyloidosis, severe chest pain indicating pericarditis, uncontrolled fevers, weight loss, growth retardation, high risk of amyloidosis.\n\nReturn JSON with these fields.\n\nWe need to ensure numeric confidence values between 0 and 1. For primary: 0.9. For differentials: assign e.g., 0.6 for TRAPS, 0.5 for Hyper IgD, 0.4 for PFAPA, 0.3 for systemic JIA.\n\nAlso need to include ICD-10 codes.\n\nLet's check codes:\n\n- FMF: M04.0\n\n- TRAPS: M04.2\n\n- Hyper IgD syndrome: M04.3\n\n- PFAPA: I guess M08.9? Actually PFAPA isn't a specific ICD code. But we may use M08.9 \"Juvenile idiopathic arthritis, unspecified\"? But better to use \"M08.9\" for PFAPA? But maybe \"M08.9\" is juvenile idiopathic arthritis unspecified. But PFAPA may not have specific code. We can use \"M08.9\" as placeholder. Or use \"R69\" for fever of unknown origin? But we can include \"M08.9\" or \"R69\" as code.\n\n- Systemic JIA: M08.0.\n\n- Also \"M04.8\" for other periodic fever syndromes.\n\nLet's produce JSON accordingly.\n\nAlso tests: list test objects with test and priority.\n\nManagement: immediate: supportive, colchicine, NSAIDs. Medications: list drug: dose, route. Provide \"Colchicine: 0.5 mg PO BID\" etc.\n\nNow produce JSON.\n\nCheck format: Should be JSON only, no additional text. Include arrays.\n\nLet's craft.\n\n\n\n---\n\n{\n    \"primary_diagnosis\": {\n        \"name\": \"Familial Mediterranean Fever\",\n        \"confidence\": 0.9,\n        \"icd_code\": \"M04.0\"\n    },\n    \"differential_diagnoses\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"TNF-receptor associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS)\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.6,\n            \"icd_code\": \"M04.2\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Hyper IgD syndrome (Mevalonate kinase deficiency)\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.5,\n            \"icd_code\": \"M04.3\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (Still's disease)\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.4,\n            \"icd_code\": \"M08.0\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"PFAPA syndrome (Periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, adenitis)\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.3,\n            \"icd_code\": \"R69\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Other periodic fever syndromes\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.2,\n            \"icd_code\": \"M04.8\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"key_findings\": [\n        \"Recurrent fevers lasting 1-3 days with 2-3 week intervals\",\n        \"Severe abdominal pain during attacks\",\n        \"Chest pain with dyspnea (pleuritic or pericardial)\",\n        \"Polyarthritis of knees and ankles\",\n        \"Elevated CRP, ESR, WBC during attacks\",\n        \"Complete remission between attacks\",\n        \"Positive family history in Mediterranean descent\"\n    ],\n    \"tests\": [\n        {\n            \"test\": \"MEFV gene analysis (MLPA and sequencing)\",\n            \"priority\": \"urgent\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"TNFRSF1A gene analysis\",\n            \"priority\": \"urgent\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"MVK gene analysis\",\n            \"priority\": \"routine\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Serum amyloid A (SAA)\",\n            \"priority\": \"urgent\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"CBC with differential\",\n            \"priority\": \"immediate\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"ESR and CRP\",\n            \"priority\": \"immediate\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Complement C3, C4\",\n            \"priority\": \"routine\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Abdominal ultrasound (if pain persists)\",\n            \"priority\": \"routine\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"management\": {\n        \"immediate\": [\n            \"Start colchicine prophylaxis (0.5 mg PO twice daily)\",\n            \"Administer NSAIDs for acute pain (e.g., ibuprofen 400 mg PO q6h PRN)\",\n            \"Provide supportive care (fluid, antipyretics)\",\n            \"Order urgent genetic testing (MEFV, TNFRSF1A)\",\n            \"Monitor for signs of amyloidosis (SAA, proteinuria)\"\n        ],\n        \"medications\": [\n            \"Colchicine: 0.5 mg PO twice daily (max 1.5 mg/day)\",\n            \"Ibuprofen: 400-600 mg PO q6-8h PRN\",\n            \"Prednisone: 30-40 mg PO daily for 3-",
