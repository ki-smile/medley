      "response": "Okay, let's tackle this medical case. The patient is a 28-year-old male of Mediterranean descent with recurrent episodes of fever, severe abdominal pain, chest pain with breathing difficulties, joint pain in knees and ankles, and a family history of similar symptoms in his father and uncle. The episodes last 1-3 days, occur every 2-3 weeks, and he's asymptomatic between attacks. Labs during attacks show elevated CRP, ESR, and WBC. Symptoms started in childhood, and genetic testing is pending.\n\nFirst, the Mediterranean descent makes me think of hereditary conditions. Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) is a strong possibility here. FMF presents with recurrent fevers, serositis (abdominal, chest pain), arthritis, and family history. The episodes lasting a few days and occurring periodically fit. The elevated inflammatory markers during attacks also align. The ICD-10 code for FMF is E85.0.\n\nDifferential diagnoses? Let's consider other periodic fever syndromes. Maybe TNF receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS) - also causes recurrent fever, abdominal pain, and has a family history. ICD-10 D89.8. Another possibility is Beh\u00e7et's disease, which can cause oral ulcers, joint pain, but maybe less likely without mucocutaneous symptoms mentioned. ICD-10 M35.2. Then there's Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), though the episodic nature is less typical. ICD-10 M32.9. Also, maybe gout, but the age and presentation don't fit as well. Another thought: Acute Intermittent Porphyria, but abdominal pain is more prolonged and there are neuro symptoms, which aren't noted here.\n\nKey findings would be the recurrent episodic symptoms, family history, Mediterranean descent, elevated inflammatory markers during attacks, and being asymptomatic between episodes.\n\nTests: The pending genetic testing for MEFV mutations (for FMF) is crucial, so that's a priority. Immediate tests might include serum amyloid A (SAA) to assess for amyloidosis risk. Urinalysis for proteinuria (again, amyloidosis). CRP and ESR are already done during attacks, but maybe repeat during next episode. Also, maybe a chest X-ray if there's acute chest pain to rule out other causes.\n\nManagement: Immediate steps during an attack could be pain management and monitoring. Colchicine is the mainstay for FMF prophylaxis, so starting that. Dose would be like 0.5 mg twice daily. For acute attacks, maybe NSAIDs. Consult a rheumatologist urgently for confirmation and management plan.\n\nRed flags would be signs of amyloidosis (like proteinuria), persistent symptoms beyond typical episodes, or organ damage. Also, if chest pain is severe, ruling out other causes like pulmonary embolism.\n\nWait, the genetic test is pending, so the confidence for FMF might be high but not 100%, maybe 0.9. Differentials with lower confidence. Let's structure the JSON accordingly.\n\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\n    \"primary_diagnosis\": {\n        \"name\": \"Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF)\",\n        \"confidence\": 0.9,\n        \"icd_code\": \"E85.0\"\n    },\n    \"differential_diagnoses\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"TNF receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS)\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.6,\n            \"icd_code\": \"D89.8\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.4,\n            \"icd_code\": \"M35.2\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.3,\n            \"icd_code\": \"M32.9\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"key_findings\": [\n        \"Recurrent self-limiting fever episodes (1-3 days)\",\n        \"Family history of similar symptoms (autosomal recessive pattern)\",\n        \"Mediterranean descent\",\n        \"Elevated CRP, ESR, and WBC during attacks\",\n        \"Asymptomatic between episodes\"\n    ],\n    \"tests\": [\n        {\n            \"test\": \"MEFV gene mutation analysis (confirmatory for FMF)\",\n            \"priority\": \"immediate\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Serum amyloid A (SAA) level\",\n            \"priority\": \"urgent\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Urinalysis (proteinuria assessment)\",\n            \"priority\": \"urgent\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Chest X-ray (during acute chest pain)\",\n            \"priority\": \"urgent\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"management\": {\n        \"immediate\": [\n            \"Symptomatic relief with NSAIDs during attacks\",\n            \"Monitor for signs of amyloidosis (e.g., proteinuria)\"\n        ],\n        \"medications\": [\n            \"colchicine: 0.5 mg PO twice daily (prophylaxis)\",\n            \"ibuprofen: 400-600 mg PO every 6-8 hours as needed (acute pain)\"\n        ],\n        \"consultations\": [\n            \"rheumatology: urgent\",\n            \"genetics: routine (counseling)\"\n        ]\n    },\n    \"red_flags\": [\n        \"Persistent fever >5 days\",\n        \"New-onset proteinuria or renal dysfunction\",\n        \"Neurological symptoms (e.g., seizures, confusion)\",\n        \"Severe pleuritic chest pain unresponsive to NSAIDs\"\n    ]\n}\n```",
