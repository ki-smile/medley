I'll next delve into the other critical factors.\n\n\n**Defining the Parameters**\n\nI've identified the patient's age, chief complaint of chest pain, the radiation pattern, and associated symptoms, as well as their past medical history of hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia, along with a smoking history. I'm now organizing these risk factors.\n\n\n**Refining the Diagnosis**\n\nI've now solidified the primary diagnosis as an acute inferior wall STEMI (ICD-10 code: I21.19) based on all available data. The reasoning, confidence level, and the specific ICD-10 code have been clearly stated. I'm also incorporating differential diagnoses like aortic dissection, pulmonary embolism, and pericarditis and explaining why they're less likely in this context, while including appropriate ICD-10 codes for each.\n\n\n**Creating the Structure**\n\nI'm now focused on structuring the output as a JSON object, ensuring that it includes patient details, the primary diagnosis, differential diagnoses with reasoning, key findings, and a plan for diagnostic tests, and I'm making sure it's well-organized and complete.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Assessment**\n\nI'm now synthesizing all the details. I'm putting together the diagnostic assessment, including the patient's details, the confirmed diagnosis, differential diagnoses with explanations, key findings, the diagnostic and therapeutic plan, and organizing it into a JSON format ready for use.\n\n\n**Forming the Structure**\n\nI'm now organizing all the key components, including patient specifics, diagnoses, differential considerations with justifications, salient findings, and a detailed plan for tests and treatments. My goal is to arrange everything neatly within a JSON structure.\n\n\n**Synthesizing the Findings**\n\nI'm now ready to create the JSON object, which will combine all of my previous assessments. I will integrate the patient details, confirm the diagnosis, provide differential considerations, present key findings, detail the diagnostic and therapeutic plan, and ensure its well-formatted.\n\n\n**Compiling the Information**\n\nI'm now translating the detailed clinical scenario, including patient specifics, findings, diagnoses, and plans, into the prescribed JSON format, ensuring accurate representation and compliance.\n\n\n**Structuring the JSON**\n\nI'm focused on building the JSON object that encapsulates all findings: patient details, primary and differential diagnoses with reasoning and ICD-10 codes, key findings, the management plan, and a concise follow-up plan.
