Asymptomatic between attacks. Started age 7. Genetic testing pending. Mediterranean descent, periodic fever episodes, abdominal pain, pleuritic chest pain, arthritis, familial. Likely Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF). Primary diagnosis: FMF, confidence high maybe 0.95, ICD-10 code: M72.0? Wait FMF code: M72.0 is \"Familial Mediterranean fever\". Yes.\n\nDifferential diagnoses: other periodic fever syndromes: TNF-receptor associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS) (M72.2). Hyperimmunoglobulinemia D with periodic fever syndrome (HIDS) (M72.1?). Actually HIDS code: M72.1. Also systemic autoinflammatory diseases like cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome (CAPS) (M72.3). Also acute rheumatic fever? But not typical. Also Seronegative spondyloarthropathy? But periodic. So we can list: TRAPS, HIDS, CAPS, Acute rheumatic fever? But maybe better: Acute pericarditis? But no. So 4-5 differential.\n\nKey findings: recurrent fever, abdominal pain, chest pain, arthritis, family history, elevated inflammatory markers, asymptomatic between attacks, Mediterranean descent. Genetic testing pending.\n\nTests: Genetic testing for MEFV gene (FMF), CRP/ESR baseline, serum amyloid A, complement levels, ANA, RF? But priority: immediate: genetic testing, baseline labs, amyloid protein. Urgent: CRP, ESR, WBC. Routine: serum amyloid A, complement levels, ANA, RF, hepatitis panel. Also consider imaging? Not necessary.\n\nManagement: immediate: NSAIDs for pain, colchicine prophylaxis. Medications: colchicine 0.5 mg BID (dose may vary). For severe episodes: high-dose NSAIDs, corticosteroids. Also consider TNF inhibitors if refractory. Consultations: Rheumatology urgent; Infectious disease? Maybe.\n\nRed flags: signs of amyloidosis (proteinuria), severe chest pain indicating pericarditis, peritonitis requiring surgery, uncontrolled fever >6 days, severe abdominal pain, organ dysfunction, high WBC >30k, etc.\n\nNeed to produce JSON only.\n\nLet's produce JSON with the structure.\n\nWe need to include medication doses: e.g., colchicine 0.6 mg BID (or 0.5 mg). Provide actual dosing. Provide immediate, urgent, routine.\n\nLet's choose: immediate: Genetic testing for MEFV. Urgent: Baseline inflammatory markers: CRP, ESR, WBC, serum amyloid A. Routine: ANA, RF, complement, hepatitis B/C, urinalysis for protein.\n\nConsultations: Rheumatology - urgent; Infectious disease - routine; Nephrology - if amyloidosis suspected.\n\nRed flags: proteinuria, nephrotic syndrome, persistent fever >7 days, severe chest pain with hemodynamic compromise, peritoneal perforation, neurological symptoms (CAPS).
