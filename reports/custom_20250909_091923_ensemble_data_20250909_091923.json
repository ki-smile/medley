      "response": "Okay, let's tackle this medical case. The patient is a 28-year-old male of Mediterranean descent with recurrent fever episodes, abdominal pain, chest pain, joint pain, and a family history of similar symptoms. The episodes started in childhood, occur every 2-3 weeks, and labs show elevated CRP, ESR, and WBC during attacks but he's asymptomatic between them.\n\nFirst, considering the recurrent nature, family history, and Mediterranean origin, Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) comes to mind. FMF is an autosomal recessive disorder common in that ethnic group. The symptoms like fever, abdominal pain, serositis (chest pain), and arthritis fit. The episodic pattern and response to colchicine also support this. The ICD-10 code for FMF is E85.0. Confidence is high, maybe 0.9.\n\nDifferential diagnoses should include other periodic fever syndromes. TNF receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS) could be a possibility, with longer fever episodes but also autosomal dominant inheritance. ICD-10 is D89.8. Confidence lower, maybe 0.3. Also, Beh\u00e7et's disease, but it usually has oral/genital ulcers, which aren't mentioned here. So confidence 0.2, ICD-10 M35.2. Another differential is Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA), but the episodic nature isn't typical. Confidence 0.15, ICD-10 M08.2. Lastly, maybe gout, but joint involvement here is knees and ankles, more typical of FMF. Confidence 0.1, ICD-10 M10.9.\n\nKey findings would be the recurrent fevers, family history, Mediterranean descent, episodic symptoms with lab inflammation, and asymptomatic periods.\n\nTests: Genetic testing for MEFV mutations is crucial, priority immediate. Also, serum amyloid A (SAA) to check for amyloidosis risk. CRP/ESR during attack is already done. Maybe urinalysis for proteinuria. Also, imaging like abdominal ultrasound, but maybe routine priority.\n\nManagement: Immediate pain management with NSAIDs like ibuprofen. Colchicine is standard for FMF prophylaxis. Dose would be colchicine 0.5 mg twice daily. Consult rheumatology urgently. Also, genetic counseling given family history.\n\nRed flags include signs of amyloidosis (like proteinuria), severe chest pain indicating possible pericarditis, or unresponsive episodes which could mean a different diagnosis.\n\nNeed to make sure all ICD codes are correct. Checked FMF is E85.0. TRAPS is under autoinflammatory disorders, D89.8. Beh\u00e7et's is M35.2. Systemic JIA is M08.2. Gout M10.9. Medications: colchicine dose is correct. Tests ordered by priority. OK, that should cover it.\n\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\n    \"primary_diagnosis\": {\n        \"name\": \"Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF)\",\n        \"confidence\": 0.9,\n        \"icd_code\": \"E85.0\"\n    },\n    \"differential_diagnoses\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"TNF receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS)\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.3,\n            \"icd_code\": \"D89.8\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.2,\n            \"icd_code\": \"M35.2\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.15,\n            \"icd_code\": \"M08.2\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Gout\",\n            \"confidence\": 0.1,\n            \"icd_code\": \"M10.9\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"key_findings\": [\n        \"Recurrent self-limiting fever episodes\",\n        \"Mediterranean descent with family history of similar symptoms\",\n        \"Serositis (abdominal/chest pain) and arthritis\",\n        \"Elevated inflammatory markers during attacks\",\n        \"Asymptomatic between episodes since childhood\"\n    ],\n    \"tests\": [\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Genetic testing for MEFV mutations\",\n            \"priority\": \"immediate\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Serum amyloid A (SAA) protein level\",\n            \"priority\": \"urgent\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"CRP/ESR during attack (already completed)\",\n            \"priority\": \"routine\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"test\": \"Urinalysis for proteinuria\",\n            \"priority\": \"urgent\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"management\": {\n        \"immediate\": [\"NSAIDs for pain relief during attacks\"],\n        \"medications\": [\"colchicine: 0.5 mg orally twice daily (prophylaxis)\"],\n        \"consultations\": [\"Rheumatology: urgent\", \"Genetic counseling: routine\"]\n    },\n    \"red_flags\": [\n        \"Persistent proteinuria (risk of amyloidosis)\",\n        \"Prolonged chest pain suggesting pericarditis\",\n        \"Failure to respond to colchicine therapy\"\n    ]\n}\n```",

Actually FMF is M72.2 (Familial Mediterranean fever). Yes. So primary diagnosis: FMF. Confidence ~0.95.\n\nDifferential diagnoses: \n- Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) - but not typical in male, but still. ICD-10 M32.9.\n- Adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD) - ICD-10 M30.1? Actually M30.1 is \"Adult-onset Still's disease\". \n- Beh\u00e7et disease - M35.0.\n- Recurrent pericarditis/pleuritis due to other causes? But we need 3-5. Also consider:\n- Periodic fever syndromes like TRAPS (TNF receptor-associated periodic syndrome) - ICD-10 M72.3 (maybe not). But we can mention anyway.\n\nKey findings: recurrent febrile episodes with serositis (abdominal, chest), migratory arthritis, elevated acute phase reactants, Mediterranean ancestry, autosomal recessive.\n\nTests: Genetic testing for MEFV mutations (urgent). Serum amyloid A (SAA) (routine). Complement levels? Also evaluate for other periodic fever syndromes: TNFRSF1A gene (TRAPS), NLRP3 (CAPS).\n\nAlso need to check for amyloidosis: baseline serum amyloid A, eGFR, proteinuria. Also baseline echocardiogram? But maybe not.\n\nManagement: immediate: NSAIDs or colchicine prophylaxis. Actually for FMF, colchicine is first-line prophylaxis. During attacks, NSAIDs, colchicine, steroids if severe. So immediate: colchicine 0.5 mg twice daily. If acute attack, consider colchicine 0.5 mg q8h during attack. Also consider corticosteroids (prednisone 50-60 mg). Also consider IL-1 inhibitors like anakinra for refractory.\n\nConsultations: Rheumatology urgent; Genetic counseling.\n\nRed flags: Persistent high CRP, renal involvement, decreased kidney function, proteinuria, amyloidosis.\n\nLet's produce JSON.\n\nWe also need to provide confidence values for each differential.\n\nDifferential list: SLE 0.2, AOSD 0.25, Beh\u00e7et 0.15, TRAPS 0.1, CAPS 0.1?

Actually TRAPS is \"Familial periodic fever, unspecified\"? Checking quickly: The ICD-10 code for \"Autoinflammatory disease, other specified\" maybe M72.3? But we can approximate. But better to use M72.3 \"Other disorders of the musculoskeletal system\" no. Let's search memory: TRAPS is M72.3 \"Other specified autoinflammatory diseases\"? Actually M72.3 is \"Other specified musculoskeletal disorders\". Might not be correct. But we can still provide approximate. But requirement says provide ICD-10 codes when known. So we can provide codes for known ones: FMF, SLE, AOSD, Beh\u00e7et. For TRAPS and CAPS, we might use M72.3 and M72.4 as placeholders. But better to provide \"unknown\" or \"N/A\". But requirement says Provide ICD-10 codes when known. So for unknown we can leave as \"N/A\".\n\nOk let's produce JSON.\n\n---\n\n```json\n{\n  \"primary_diagnosis\": {\n    \"name\": \"Familial Mediterranean Fever\",\n    \"confidence\": 0.95,\n    \"icd_code\": \"M72.2\"\n  },\n  \"differential_diagnoses\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Systemic Lupus Erythematosus\",\n      \"confidence\": 0.20,\n      \"icd_code\": \"M32.9\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Adult\u2011onset Still\u2019s Disease\",\n      \"confidence\": 0.25,\n      \"icd_code\": \"M30.1\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Beh\u00e7et Disease\",\n      \"confidence\": 0.15,\n      \"icd_code\": \"M35.0\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"TNF\u2011Receptor Associated Periodic Syndrome (TRAPS)\",\n      \"confidence\": 0.10,\n      \"icd_code\": \"N/A\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Cryopyrin\u2011Associated Periodic Syndromes (CAPS)\",\n      \"confidence\": 0.10,\n      \"icd_code\": \"N/A\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"key_findings\": [\n    \"Recurrent fever with 1\u20113\u2011day duration\",\n    \"Serosal involvement (abdominal, pleural, pericardial pain)\",\n    \"Migratory arthritis affecting knees and ankles\",\n    \"Elevated CRP, ESR, WBC during attacks\",\n    \"Mediterranean ancestry and autosomal recessive inheritance pattern\",\n    \"Complete remission between attacks\"\n  ],\n  \"tests\": [\n    {\n      \"test\": \"MEFV gene mutation analysis (e.g., exon 2, 3, 5, 10)\",\n      \"priority\": \"urgent\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"test\": \"Serum Amyloid A (SAA) level\",\n      \"priority\": \"routine\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"test\": \"Baseline renal function (eGFR, serum creatinine)\",\n      \"priority\": \"routine\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"test\": \"Urinalysis with protein/creatinine ratio\",\n      \"priority\": \"routine\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"test\": \"TNFRSF1A and NLRP3 gene panels (for TRAPS and CAPS)\",\n      \"priority\": \"routine\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"test\": \"Complement levels (C3, C4)\",\n      \"priority\": \"routine\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"management\": {\n    \"immediate\": [\n      \"Start colchicine 0.5 mg twice daily for prophylaxis\",\n      \"If acute attack: colchicine 0.5 mg every 8 hours until fever resolves\",\n      \"Consider NSAID (e.g., ibuprofen 400 mg PO q6h) for pain\",\n      \"If severe or refractory: prednisone 0.5\u20131 mg/kg/day (max 60 mg) tapered over 2\u20134 weeks\"\n    ],\n    \"medications\": [\n      \"colchicine: 0.5 mg PO BID (adjust for renal/hepatic function)\",\n      \"ibuprofen: 400 mg PO q6h PRN\",\n      \"prednisone: 0.5\u20131 mg/kg/day PO (max 60 mg) taper\",\n      \"anakinra 100 mg SC daily (if colchicine\u2011resistant or severe amyloidosis risk)\"\n    ],\n    \"consultations\": [\n      \"Rheumatology: urgent\",\n      \"Genetic counseling: urgent\",\n      \"Nephrology: routine if proteinuria or renal dysfunction detected\"\n    ]\n  },\n  \"red_flags\": [\n    \"Persistent elevation of SAA > 10 mg/L between attacks\",\n    \"New onset proteinuria > 300 mg/day or hematuria\",\n    \"Renal dysfunction (eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m\u00b2)\",\n    \"Uncontrolled fever > 48 h despite colchicine\",\n    \"Worsening chest or abdominal pain suggestive of pericarditis or peritonitis\",\n    \"Signs of amyloidosis (e.g., unexplained fatigue, edema, arrhythmias)\"\n  ]\n}\n```",
